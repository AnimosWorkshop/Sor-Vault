### Pronouns

In Temuthen, pronouns are divided into first, second and third person, each taking the appropriate [[Grammatical Gender|suffix]] according to the person's gender. Note that for a neuter singular form, the 'e' is always added for pronouns.

* First person - IIþ
* Second person - IIx
* Third person - IIl

The third person neuter form, ūle, is also used as an unspecified 'it'.
<u>Example:</u> In the term *saf ūle* (lit. 'and it'), which means 'etc.'.

### Vocative Case

To indicate a vocative case, such as calling someone according to their name or some noun, use the _ū-_ prefix at the start of the word.
<u>Example:</u> Gij þonsūe þos taxtilk, _ū-fezniene_! - Come here, _friend_!

### Demonstratives

In Temuþen, demonstratives count as being a descriptor of the noun, and so they come after it.

* knel - that
* zev - this

<u>Example:</u> IIla fuklūa iv _laþieþo knel_. - She is looking for _that boy_.
