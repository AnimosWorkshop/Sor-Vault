These are rules designed to save redundant information regarding the subject of a sentence or a clause when they are able to be inferred from context.
* When no subject is present, assume the subject is the speaker.
	<u>Example:</u> *Bul hidūa* ta trau can ta nekarieno. - *I bought* the drinks from the brewer.
* After a word opening a clause, such as _gel_ or _saf_, add the relevant gender suffix to indicate a contextual subject to it. Instead of the first word in the clause being capitalized, the first letter of the gender suffix is instead capitalized to emphasize in writing.
	<u>Example:</u> Þonsūo to Blien, _gelO kūo_ feznieno ūþuro. - I'm going to Blien, _who is_ my friend.
