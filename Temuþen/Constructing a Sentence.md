Typical sentences in Temuþen are formed in the following way:
$$\text{Subject} \longrightarrow \text{Predicate} $$
Each of those two parts may be augmented by further descriptions. For example, the subject can be augmented by adjectives, and the [[Verbs|predicate]] by several kinds of augmentations, mainly via adverbs and prepositions via many different conjunctions.

While like in English, one may add different [[Conjunctions|objects]] to the sentence:
* Direct object via _iv_.
* Indirect object via _can_ or _cim_, with _can_ taking the place of _from_ and _cim_ taking the place of _to_ / _for_.

These can be considered additions to the sentence which are not directly augmenting the predicate, but are present in the sentence as a main topic themselves. Therefore, while a sentence like _IIþo renūo ūxiva_ (I love you) is correct in Temuþen, so is _IIþo ūxiva renūo_ (with the same meaning).

Augmentations always come after the word they augment, and they may have their own augments, etc.
An important exception to this order is the word 'ta', which is similar to the word 'the', and it always comes right before the object it indicates.

>[!example] 
>*Ta wavien* (The student) *savikūo* (think) *ret zorm* (lit. in now) *haf ta cecnieno zeviulo* (lit. about the teacher new)

## Questions

Note that as the predicate can have many verbs, it's important not to lose track of whether the new augmentations refer to the original verb, which may have been many words earlier.

Questions in Temuþen are constructed in a simple manner of:
$$\text{Question Word}\longrightarrow\text{Subject} \longrightarrow \text{Predicate} $$
The different question words are:

| Temuþen | English                     |
| ------- | --------------------------- |
| þrac    | which                       |
| þrag    | what                        |
| þrak    | why                         |
| þral    | how                         |
| þram    | whether (yes / no question) |
| þran    | when                        |
| þras    | who                         |
| ur þras | whose                       |
| þrat    | how much / how many         |
| þraz    | where                       |

## Subject Prioritization


These are rules designed to save redundant information regarding the subject of a sentence or a clause when they are able to be inferred from context.
* When no subject is present, assume the subject is the speaker.
	<u>Example:</u> *Bul hidūa* ta trau can ta nekarieno. - *I bought* the drinks from the brewer.
* After a word opening a clause, such as _gel_ or _saf_, add the relevant gender suffix to indicate a contextual subject to it. Instead of the first word in the clause being capitalized, the first letter of the gender suffix is instead capitalized to emphasize in writing.
	<u>Example:</u> Þonsūo to Blien, _gel**o** kūo_ feznieno ūþuro. - I'm going to Blien, _who is_ my friend.
