Typical sentences in Temuþen are formed in the following way:
$$\text{Subject} \longrightarrow \text{Predicate} $$
Each of those two parts may be augmented by further descriptions. For example, the subject can be augmented by adjectives, and the [[Actions|predicate]] by several kinds of augmentations:
* Direct object via 'iv'.
* Indirect object via 'can' or 'cim', with 'can' taking the place of 'from' and 'cim' taking the place of 'to / for'.
* Adverbs and prepositions via many different conjunctions.

Augmentations always come after the word they augment, and they may have their own augments, etc.
An important exception to this order is the word 'ta', which is similar to the word 'the', and it always comes right before the object it indicates.

><u>Example:</u> *Ta wavien* (The student) *savikūo* (think) *ret zorm* (lit. in now) *haf ta cecnieno zeviulo* (lit. about the teacher new)

Note that as the predicate can have many verbs, it's important not to lose track of whether the new augmentations refer to the original verb, which may have been many words earlier.
