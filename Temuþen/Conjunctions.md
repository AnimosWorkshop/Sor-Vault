### Using Conjunctions with Pronouns

When conjunctions should be added before pronouns in order to modify them, they are instead inserted into the pronoun itself. The resulting word is:
$$\text{Nth-Person Indicator}+\text{Conjunction}+\text{Gender Indicator}$$
For example, the word *ūxura* means *your* (female singular), as it is constructed as *ūx*+*ur*+*a*.
