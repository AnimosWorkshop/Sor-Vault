### Comparative

For _rar_ and _nan_, since they are obvious indicators no additional word is needed to convey comparison (such as _then_ in English). However, it might be helpful to open a clause with _gel_ for a more elaborate description of the thing compared to.
<u>Example:</u> IIle bul pasrūe iv zorma _rar gel Bul savikūo_ - It took _more_ time _than I thought_.

* ilet - least
* itel - most
* rar - more
* nan - less
