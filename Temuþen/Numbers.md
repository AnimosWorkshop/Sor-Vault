### Cardinal Numbers

When using cardinal numbers to indicate an amount, it should come right after the noun but before any adjectives. 
>[!example]
>*Laþieþou rin zebiulou* means *three little boys*.

### Weekdays

Weekdays used to not have names and were simply called "the first day", "the second day" etc. for the seven days of the week. However, over time the word for 'day' and the ordinal were merged, and today Temuþen has the following names:
<p style="text-align:center;">saveiun ; savediun ; saveriun ; savekiun ; saveciun ; savesiun ; saveliun</p>

### Rational Numbers

By using _bez-_, we may express a number which is $\frac pq$ as _p-bez-q_, or _bez-q_ for short if $p=1$. For example, _bez-din_ means _half_, and _rin-bez-kin_ means _three fourths_.

### Multiplication

By using _zeb-_, we may express multiplying an amount. For example, _zeb-din_ means _double_ / _by two_. Conversely, we may use _zebez-_ to multiply by the inverse amount, so _zebez-sin_ means _six times less_ / _by a sixth_.
