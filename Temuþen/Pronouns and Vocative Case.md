In Temuthen, pronouns are divided into first, second and third person, each taking the appropriate [[Grammatical Gender|suffix]] according to the person's gender. Note that for a neuter singular form, the 'e' is always added for pronouns.

* First person - IIþ
* Second person - IIx
* Third person - IIl

The third person neuter form, ūle, is also used as an unspecified 'it'.

><u>Example:</u> In the term *saf ūle* (lit. 'and it'), which means 'etc.'.
