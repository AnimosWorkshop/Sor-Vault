Actions initially come in their infinitive form, ending with an _Å«_ suffix. From it, verbs can be formed in the following ways:

* Present - add one of the [[Grammatical Gender|grammatical gender suffixes]] to indicate the performer of the action.
* Past - same as present, with the addition of the word _bul_ before the verb.
* Future - same as present, with the addition of the word _lub_ before the verb.
* Imperative - same as present, with the addition of the word _gij_ before the verb. Note that sentences in imperative usually do not include the subject, but may include them as a form of emphasis (e.g., as in "You, clean that up already!").
* Passive - the verb is modifier with a _mal-_ prefix. Some examples are in the [[Actions and Derived Nouns|actions list]].
