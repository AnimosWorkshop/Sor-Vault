_As a culture, halflings developed a nonchalant attitude, trusting the world to fix itself for them, and so many become adventurers, yet not all seek gold and glory - and many live humble lives in small villages, seizing the day with relaxation._

## Subraces
### Lightfoot Halfling
 
_Lightfoot halfling society is more open than of other halfling subraces. They are the most common in mixed cities, always up for a chat or trade, which made them a name of traveling merchants. Many worship Yezikol, the Mirror Merchant and Venandi, the Traveler as a result, and the fortune they accumulate over their lives allows for a happy retirement when the time eventually comes. Enjoying this kind of life, the majority of the upper-caste lightfoot halflings educate their children in the same manner._

### Strongheart Halfling
 
_Strongheart halflings tend to live in clans, feeling a great amount of camaraderie and pride. That is not to say that they are hostile or cold towards other races, but the sense of longing for their clan’s safety often rivals their other allegiances in attempting to understand which is more important. While some decide to challenge that and find out on their own, others avoid the inner conflict by resorting to staying within the clan, which obviously works better for older halflings than the younger generations._
