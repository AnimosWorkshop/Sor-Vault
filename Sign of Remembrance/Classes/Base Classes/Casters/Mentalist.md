## Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a mentalist, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Charisma 13.** Being able to influence others and to truly touch others, at least some amount of true charisma is required from the performer.
- **Proficient with Persuasion or Deception.** Whether be it twisting the truth or making it up completely, mentalists are aware that in order to convince people, appealing to one's heart tends to buy their attention.
- **Novice with Sorcery.** As mentalists are histolects, who manipulate bonds to manifest their magic, they must have a basic understanding of their powers.
- **Complete special training.** Many people know how to influence others, but not all truly become mentalists. A mentalist has gone through special training to bring out the potential hidden within themselves, and harness their charm to their cause using the art of histolecty.

## Class Features
 
### Histolect
 
At 1st level, you become a [Histolect](Histolecty.md). For each of your mentalist levels, your histolect level increases by 1.
 
### Mental Sense
 
Your knowledge about histolecty, people and their habits allows you to get a good feel for the connections between creatures. Using a [[Action Economy#^3d44e8|search action]] for Sorcery (Wisdom), you are able to sense connections between creatures, both histolectual bonds and even strong friendships or animosity.
 
### Mental Specialty
 
When you reach 2nd level, your preferred method of engagement with other creatures shapes the effects of your histolectual bonds. Choose one of the following:
 
#### Charming
Your bonds enhance your influence over other creatures. While bound to a creature, you have a +2 bonus to Deception (Charisma), Persuasion (Charisma), Intimidation (Charisma) and Performance (Charisma) against them.
 
#### Investigative
Your mind becomes more aware of the creatures you are bound to. While bound to a creature, you have a +2 bonus to Insight (Wisdom) and Perception (Wisdom) checks against them, and you may use the Assess quick action on those creatures to learn an additional fact about them.
 
### Attribute Increase
 
When you reach 2nd level, and again at: 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.
 
### Silver Tongue
 
At 3rd level, you manage to more easily blend your spells into your performances. You may use this feature while casting a spell with a casting time of an action or quick action during a performance in order to make a Stealth (Charisma) check against any creature's basic Insight (Wisdom) DC. If you pass, they don't suspect you cast a spell until its effects happen. You may also attempt to use this feature while casting a spell with a casting time of an action and a quick action, but your Stealth (Charisma) check is made with disadvantage.  
If your check passed 10 + twice the spell's level, you may also spend up to 2 influence, and give the spell a +1 modifier to its spellcasting modifier for each influence spent.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in either Deception, Persuasion or Perception.
 
### Enhanced Bond Specialty
 
Starting at 4th level, you learn a special technique which allows you to manipulate one histolectual bond using a quick action in order to add an additional effect over it using an amount choose to spend at least 1 influence, and up to half your mentalist level. Choose one of the following enhancements to learn. Only one enhancement may be applied at a time, and it lasts until a minute passes, you or the other creature become unconscious, or you switch the bond.
 
#### Maddening Bond
When you damage or scare a bound creature, you may activate the bond to terrorize the target as the whispers of madness creep in, making you deal 1d3 additional psychic damage whenever you damage it or when it fails on its saving throw against your Demoralize quick action. This damage die increases by 1 for each influence spent beyond the first.
 
#### Encouraging Bond
When you target an allied creature using a spell, you may activate the bond to inspire the target to move on stronger than before, restoring 1d3 hit points whenever you target it with a spell or when you target it with your Inspire quick action. This healing die increases by 1 for each influence spent beyond the first.
 
### Psychic Tug
 
At 5th level, you learn the ability to violently pull one of your histolectual bonds. As a quick action, you may Tug a creature with whom you are histolectually bound. They take 1d6 psychic damage. This counts as 0th-level, Histolecty for the purpose of magic detection.  
In addition, the bonus you get for skill checks depending from your mental specialty increases from +2 to +3.
 
### Danger Sense
 
At 6th level, you learn how to sense danger your bound creatures feel, and tug those bonds just a bit to influence them. When creature you are bound to is attacked or is forced to make a saving throw by a creature other than you, you may use a reaction to either increase or decrease their AC against that attack or that saving throw's result by 1.  
In addition, you become proficient with Wits and Willpower saving throws.

### Enhanced Bond Heightening

At 7th level, your expertise over enhanced bonds allows you to become more versatile in how you apply them. Choose one of the following features:
#### Bond Versatility

You learn how to use the second [[#Enhanced Bond Specialty|enhanced bond]]. You may still maintain only one enhanced bond in total at a time, according to the rules detailed above.
#### Communal Enhanced Bond
 
If you currently maintain only one enhanced bond, you can choose to either:

- Maintain another enhanced bond of the type you have learned.
- Use a quick action and the same amount of influence used for your previous enhanced bond to share the effect with another creature you have histolectually bound, allowing them to trigger the same effect on your enhanced bond for as long as both are bound.
 
### Performative Casting
 
At 8th level, you are able to cast spells so elegantly you become able to weave additional messages into your spellcasting. Whenever you cast a histolecty spell, you may make an impression against a creature, either using a Demoralize quick action as a free action if you have the Maddening Bond feature, or an Inspire quick action as a free action if you have the Encouraging Bond feature.  
You may only use this feature once per round.

### Communal Branching

Constantly sustaining connections to the creatures around you not only allows you to influence your surroundings, but to be aware of it. Starting at 10th level, the creatures you bond via your [[#Enhanced Bond Specialty|enhanced bond]] share information with you constantly about the creatures they are aware of.
* You are aware to creatures they are histolectually bound to, and when they use the [[Histolecty#^8e3f1d|bind quick action]] you may use 1 reaction to switch some of your bonds to these creatures.
* You have advantage for Perception (Wisdom) checks against creatures attempting to hide while one of your enhanced bond creatures are aware of them.
* You have advantage on Willpower saves for reactions triggered by your enhanced bond creatures.
