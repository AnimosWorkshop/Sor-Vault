## Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a druid, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Wisdom 13.** You must have an understanding of the world that you try to protect in order to become its guardian.
- **Proficient with Nature.** The flora, the fauna, every inch of land that spreads across the universe - it all has meaning. It is your right and duty to know it.
- **Novice with Sorcery.** As with any mage, one who wishes to harness magic must have, even if in the most basic level of it, an understanding of their deeds.
- **Complete special training.** Not every tree-hugger can wake up one day and decide to become a druid. A true bond must be created with the natural world, and it must listen back as you call for it.

## Class Features
 
### Auramancer
 
Starting at 1st level, you become an [Auramancer](Auramancy.md). For each of your druid levels, your auramancer level increases by 1.
 
### Aura Sense
 
Becoming a druid, your study of auramancy and creatures has lead you to understand how to interpret a creature's aura. Using a [[Action Economy#^3d44e8|search action]] for Sorcery (Wisdom) allows you to see whether a creature is affected by boons or curses, their levels and magic types.
 
### Instinct Sense
 
Starting at 2nd level, your ability to read aura is improved to the point where you can understand surface-level reactions to things that it perceives or feels. This can be done using the [[Action Economy#^3d44e8|search action]] with Sorcery (Wisdom). Examples to those kinds of feelings include:

- Is the creature familiar with something that is described to it?
- Does the creature fear of, or feels awe towards what it is seeing, or of something that is described to it?
- Does the creature feel like they are at a position of advantage or disadvantage right now?

The checked creature does not know they are being inspected, as you don't need to ask these questions to know when checking. Thus the check is made against their basic Deception (Charisma) DC.
 
### Attribute Increase
 
When you reach 2nd level, and again at: 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
 
### Natural Specialty
 
As a druid, you commune with all that surrounds you - whether be it the simpler life forms, hidden beneath the sands or growing to a beautiful canopy, or more complex life forms, leaving its footmark on the land it walks upon. At 3rd level, you are able to choose which one to specialize in - travel through the natural world in all forms, utilizing simpler life forms on your way, or protection of the more complex life forms and assurance of their safety:
 
#### Travel
Whether as an adventurer, a nomad or a simple traveler, you explore the world around you in a mindful way, allowing you to utilize simple advantages of your environment and avoid hazards others wouldn't have even noticed. Your base movement speed is increased by 5', and you ignore difficult terrain, whether natural, or of a spell with level up to half your druid level.  
You may also focus your travel. Going in and out of focus uses your quick action, and while focusing on this feature, you increase your base movement speed by an additional 5', yet this causes your moves to be noticeably more graceful than others', as you get help from the surrounding flora and tread lightly. Doing so gives you a -2 penalty to Concentration checks. In addition, while focusing, you may use 1 mana as you attack to move 5' without provoking attacks of opportunity.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in Perception.
 
#### Protection
Your affinity to life allows you to transport energy efficiently to life forms, allowing you to protect either them, or from them. You may use 1 mana and a quick action to grant another creature within 10' of you an amount of temporary hit points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier for the next hour. Alternatively, you can use your reaction and 1 mana to reduce the amount of damage dealt by a creature within 10' of you by your Wisdom modifier.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in Medicine.
 
### Ex Terra
 
Starting at 4th level, your auramancy echoes through your body in such a way which allows you to stabilize your own aura, restoring your body over time. Once per round, when you spend mana, you recover that many hit points.
 
### Natural Specialty Focus
 
At 5th level, your specialization improves, allowing you to focus it to a greater extent. Depending on your natural specialty, you gain the following benefits:
 
#### Travel
You master the environment even further, allowing you to travel far, and leave your foes in the dust. Your base movement speed increases by an additional 5', and while focusing your travel, attack rolls you make against anyone who is not a travel druid are made with a +1 bonus, and you have a +1 bonus to your AC against attacks made by anyone who is not a travel druid.
 
#### Protection
Your affinity goes stronger and is able to connect to any life form efficiently, even those who have only a fragment left. Your specialty feature has both the amount of temporary hit points and the amount of damaged reduced increased by your proficiency modifier.
 
### Thorn Ward
 
At 6th level, you learn how to generate a quick and effective ward against incoming damage. As a reaction to taking damage, but before the damage takes effect, you may use any amount of mana to generate a temporary aura ward, granting you four times that many temporary hit points, or five times if you have the Protection specialty. Then, the source of the damage must make an Initiative saving throw, or be dealt necrotic damage equal to the temporary hit points lost if they are within 40'. While this ward is active, you are considered under the effect of an auramancy boon with the appropriate magic level according to the mana spent. The boon ends at the start of your next turn.  
Additionally, you become proficient with Resilience and Initiative saving throws.
 
### Instinct Harmonization Specialty
 
At 8th level, you learn how to harmonize with an instinct of your choice, feeling it course through your veins whenever the time is right. When you get this feature, choose one of the following instincts and gain its benefits:
 
#### Dominance
Attuning to dominance, you strike those who oppose you to become alpha. While you are above half your maximum hit points, you get a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls against targets below half their maximum hit points.
#### Fear
Attuning to fear, you become more agitated. The horror of death, not being exclusive to our soul, but also to our very body, motivates you to be aware of danger and continue on your path. While you are below half your maximum hit points, you have a +2 bonus to saving throws, and your movement speed increases by 10'.  
In addition, while making a ranged attack you may infuse your attack with your instinct, allowing you to move 5' away from your target. Attacks of opportunity during this movement are made with disadvantage.
#### Growth
Attuning to growth, your focus shifts to not on what was lost - but on what can be gained. Whenever you spend mana, you recover hit points equal to the amount of mana spent. In addition, whenever you lose at least 7 hit points in one instance, you recover mana equal to the amount of hit points lost divided by 7 (rounded down).
 
### Sanguimancy
 
As many know, the highest form of auramancy entails using one's own life force in order to exceed the limits of normal casting, but it comes in the form of expending the vitality of the mage's aura instead of their physical blood. At 10th level, you may use this knowledge to your advantage. When you cast a spell, you may use up your hit dice in order to upcast the spell. Each 2 hit dice you use raise the spell's level and the auramancy modifier for that spell by 1, and you lose 1d8 hit points for each level. The affected spells act as if they were supplied an amount of mana equal to their appropriate spell level.  
Hit dice used this way are replenished as they normally would during long rests.
