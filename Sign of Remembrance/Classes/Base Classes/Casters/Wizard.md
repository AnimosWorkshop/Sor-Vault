## Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a wizard, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Intelligence 13.** An exceptional ability to study the arcane is mandatory to become a good wizard.
- **Adept with Sorcery.** Sorcery, and arcana in particular, is the key of wizardry. Through study and research, you gain your ability, and so you must learn them.
- **Complete special training.** Anyone can research, but not everyone have the capabilities of harnessing magic and becoming a wizard. Even beyond the studies of arcana, wizards understand what is required to stand on the other end of a spell - and live through it.

## Class Features
 
### Arcanist
 
As a wizard, you become an [[Arcana|arcanist]]. For each of your wizard levels, your arcanist level increases by 1.
 
### Spatial Sense
 
Studying arcana and the effects magic has on the physical world allows you to notice special details about it. Using a [[Action Economy#^3d44e8|search action]] for Sorcery (Wisdom) allows you to estimate the strength of the arcane field around you, and whether a creature is trained with magic or not.
 
### Arcane Orb Specialty
 
At 2nd level, you learn the technique of manifesting a sliver of your arcane energy as a tiny orb, which hovers close to you. You can manifest the orb or make it dissipate using a quick action, and control its movement with your thought, though it can't go further than 5' from you.  
As you gain this feature, choose 1 school of magic, which becomes your chosen school for both this feature, and other wizard features which will come up at later levels. Depending on the school you choose, while the orb is manifested, you gain a +1 bonus to skill checks and DC's of one the following skills:

- Alteration - pressing on and manipulating the structure of objects, you get a bonus to Athletics
- Augury - enhancing your deduction and understanding flow of events, you get a bonus to Investigation
- Calefaction - revealing more of the world with your magic, you get a bonus to Perception
- Displacement - understanding the dynamics of objects in the world, you get a bonus to Acrobatics
- Puppeteering - changing the Arcane Web to create precise yet powerful movements through space, you get a bonus to Sleight of Hand
- Tempest - harnessing power common with weather and nature, you get a bonus to Intimidation

This bonus increases by to +2 when you reach 4th level, and to +3 at 7th level.

### Orb Storage
 
Also at 2nd level, you understand how to store energy in your arcane orb in order to become more flexible over a work day. Once every long rest, you may cast an arcana spell in the highest resonance level you have of the school you chose with Arcane Orb if your orb is manifested.

### Arcane Eye
 
Starting at 3rd level, when you see a spell being cast within 90' of you, you may use your reaction to make a Sorcery (Intelligence) check against a DC of 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, you recognize the spell's magic type and level.  
When you recognize a spell, you may use this feature to place a barrier around you to endure the blow, and either:

- If the spell requires an attack and targets you, impose disadvantage on the attack.
- If the spell targets you and forces you to make a saving throw, gain advantage on the saving throw.

The barrier may be used twice before needing to recharge over a short or long rest.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in either Sorcery, Perception or Investigation.
 
### Specialty School
 
Arcana takes many forms, but over time distinct styles have evolved, forming different schools of magic. Wizards adapt to a specific school of their choice and become more efficient with it during their training, specifically - at 4th and 7th level.  
When you get this feature at 4th level, your chosen school from Arcane Orb becomes your specialty school. You have a +1 bonus to your spellcasting modifier for spells of this school. At 7th level, this bonus increases to +2.
 
### Spatial Deformation
 
At 5th level, you learn a technique which allows you to slightly modify space around you on a whim, making it difficult for creatures and objects to pass through it. Using a quick action, you choose a 15' cube in space, up to 60' away from you. Until the start of your next turn, the area becomes difficult terrain, and counts as giving half-cover if ranged attacks are supposed to pass through the area. The effect doesn't stack with itself. This counts as 0th-level, Arcana for the purpose of magic detection.
 
### Arcane Eye Expertise
 
At 6th level, your ability to read other creatures' spells increases on an intuitive level. Once you have used the Arcane Eye feature successfully, you get a +1 stacking bonus for AC and saving throws against the creature's spells, until you take a short or long rest.  
In addition, the Arcane Eye feature may now be used thrice instead of twice before needing to recharge, and you become proficient with Wits and Initiative saving throws.
 
### Specialty Transformation
 
At 8th level, your mastery over your school of magic affects your body more than ever, causing your presence in the world to be irreversibly changed.
 
#### Alteration
The arcane web bends around you, causing objects coming fast towards you to temporarily deform. Whenever you are attacked, reduce the weapon or spell's damage by 2 for the rest of the turn, before damage is rolled. You may use a reaction to increase that effect to 3 against the attack. This effect stacks.
 
#### Augury
Your deduction heightens, allowing you to logically predict the immediate future of many things around you, but also making you visibly distracted by everything. You may choose to use Intelligence instead of any other attribute for Initiative saves, meaning your Initiative saves are unaffected by conditions such as [[Conditions#Encumbered|encumbered]]. In addition, you add half your Intelligence modifier to Willpower saving throws.
 
#### Calefaction
Your body alternates between exuding great heat to great cold. You become resistant to fire, cold and radiant damage, and your fire, cold and radiant damage rolls are made with a +2 bonus.
 
#### Displacement
Your body blinks as you move, making it hard to predict your exact location at any moment. You become immune to [[Action Economy#Opportunity Attacks|opportunity attacks]], and your base speed increases by 10'.
 
#### Puppeteering
You are able to control one unattended objects within your reach using quick alterations in the web. Once per turn, you may use a minor interaction as a free action, and you may "hold" one object with the arcane web as if you had a third arm.
 
#### Tempest
You become able to build up charge around you, crackling lightly whenever you do. Whenever you cast a spell or take at least 5 damage, you build up 1 charge. At the start of your turn, you release all charges - dealing thunder damage equal to quadruple that amount to a creature within 30'. You may also discharge to the air around you, dealing damage to nothing.
 
### Arcane Deflection
 
At 9th level, your understanding of spells and sorcery leads you to master the art of deflection, allowing you to channel thrown-off ranged spell attacks to your own use. When a ranged spell attack misses you, if the projectile remains, you may use your reaction to attempt to take control over the spell. You make a ranged spell attack of your own, and if you roll higher than the attack against you, the projectile is propelled to another creature you can see. This attack's range is the range remaining from the original spell. You may attempt to use this feature an amount of times equal to your Intelligence modifier. Uses of this feature replenish when you finish a long rest.
 
### Negation
 
At 10th level, your power as an arcanist becomes so incredibly strong that you are able to overpower spells using your resonance. When you successfully recognize a spell using your Arcane Eye feature, you may use an additional reaction to use up a resonance of the same level or higher than the spell being cast. If you do, the spell is negated, dissipating as the Arcane Web absorbs its power.
