## Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a sentinel, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Wisdom 13.** One must be capable of undertaking the duty of a sentinel, knowing both themselves and others.
- **Proficient with Insight**. Sentinels are well-trained in the art of studying both their environment and themselves in order to channel their will into action.
- **Novice with Perception.** It is not sufficient to see; sentinels must be able to discern the details from the background and tell their condition at a glance.
- **Complete special training.** Not all are suited to become sentinels. You've probably had a teacher who taught you both the concepts of attention and focus, which in turn helped you understand the world around you.

## Class Features
 
### Harmony within Everything
 
As a sentinel, you know how to find peace and be able to concentrate on the world around you and on bettering yourself. During a short rest, you recover additional hit points equal to your sentinel level. In addition, you gain temporary hit points equal to your sentinel level whenever you finish a short or long rest.  
In addition, when a breakage level would apply to your unarmed strikes or natural armor, make a flat check with a DC equal to 11 - your sentinel level. If you succeed, the breakage level doesn't apply.
 
### Inner Focus
 
You have trained your mind to enter a state of coordination between body and mind. You have a number of charges called Focus, which you may use for different sentinel features. The maximum amount of focus you have is equal to your sentinel level. Half of this is regained when finishing a short rest, and all is recovered when finishing a long rest.  
You may use an action and 1 focus to become Focused, using your [[Reading a Spell Entry|concentration]] slot to allow the world around you to become clearer - you can control your senses more easily, focusing on whatever you'd like, your body is honed and prepared to deal with that which threatens it. While focused:

- You have a +1 bonus for Perception (Wisdom) checks.
- Your [[Weaponsmith#Commoners' Melee Weapons|unarmed strikes]] have their damage die increased by 1, and you may use all functional limbs in order to perform unarmed strikes and the [[Action Economy#^5d5dd0|shove]] brawl action. Gauntlet weapons are also affected by this bonus.
- Your natural armor AC increases by 1.
- You gain access to the Deflect reaction against an incoming attack, increasing your AC by your Strength modifier divided by 3 against it.
- You have a +1 bonus to saving throws.

The focused condition lasts 10 minutes, and your concentration on it cannot end due to taking damage. You may also take a quick action right after the Focus action to make an unarmed strike.
 
### Deflecting Instinct
 
Also at 2nd level, you learn how to deflect incoming attacks using precise, deliberate movements. This allows you to substitute your Dexterity modifier when calculating AC with your Strength modifier, as you attempt to deflect and push away incoming blows instead of dodging them.  

>[!note] 
>Limitations and changes to how you add your Dexterity modifier for AC calculation, such as heavy armor not allowing you to add Dexterity for AC calculation, applies to this feature too. Therefore, a 2nd level sentinel wearing chain plate has AC 15 regardless of their Strength modifier.
 
### Martial Techniques
 
At 2nd level, you learn the  use of [[Sign of Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]]. Whenever you gain this feature, you may use its preparation slots to prepare either techniques of this class or a general technique. You may choose to prepare a basic technique instead of an advanced technique if you fulfill its class requirements.
 

| **Sentinel** **Level** | **Basic Techniques** | **Advanced Techniques** |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2nd                    | 1                    | -                       |
| 4th                    | 2                    | -                       |
| 6th                    | 3                    | -                       |
| 8th                    | 3                    | 1                       |
| 10th                   | 3                    | 2                       |
 
### Attribute Increase
 
When you reach 2nd level, and again at: 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.
 
### Focus Strikes
 
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your focus in a concise strike that delivers a shockwave to the attacked  
creature. At the start of your turn, you may use 1 focus to empower your weapon attacks for the remainder of the turn, adding 1d6 force to your damage rolls. If you manage to hit with two focus strikes against the same creature during a turn, and they are of one size category above yours or lower, it must succeed on a Resilience saving throw against a DC equal to 10 + your Strength modifier + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency modifier, or become stunned until the end of their next turn.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in any skill of your choice.
 
### Enhanced Focus
 
At 4th level, you have managed to enhance your focus further. While focused, your unarmed strike damage die, the bonus you gain to Perception (Wisdom) checks and your natural armor AC increases by 1, in addition to your movement speed being increased by 5'.
 
### Deflection Expertise
 
At 5th level, your deflection skills are heightened to the point of being able to diminish any attack. Whenever you use the Deflect reaction, you become resistant to the damage of the incoming attack.
 
### Stance
 
At 6th level, you may choose to focus on a particular fighting style, granting you stability and power in new ways. When you use an action to become focused, you may choose one of the following stances, which lasts until your focus breaks:

- Defensive Stance: You bolster your body and anchor it to the ground, granting you a +1 bonus to your AC and a +1 bonus to saving throws.
- Offensive Stance: Your weapon becomes an extension of your body and even your unarmed strikes are bolstered. You have a +1 bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls.

You may also change your stance while focused as a quick action.  
In addition, you become proficient with Resilience and Initiative saving throws.
 
### Watchful Combatant
 
At 7th level, your mastery over yourselves and others shows in your reflexes and ability to manipulate a dangerous situation to your advantage. You become proficient with Willpower saving throws. In addition, whenever an enemy moves willingly within your reach for the first time each round, you may make an attack of opportunity against them with advantage. This does not use a reaction.
 
### Focused Respite
 
At 8th level, you become able to focus your inner focus in order to restore health. As a quick action while you focus, you may use 1 focus point and up to 2 hit dice in order to heal an amount of hit points equal to the result of those hit dice + twice the sum of your Constitution, Willpower and Wisdom modifier.
