## Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a sentinel, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Wisdom 13.** One must be capable of undertaking the duty of a sentinel, knowing both themselves and others.
- **Proficient with Insight**. Sentinels are well-trained in the art of studying both their environment and themselves in order to channel their will into action.
- **Novice with Perception.** It is not sufficient to see; sentinels must be able to discern the details from the background and tell their condition at a glance.
- **Complete special training.** Not all are suited to become sentinels. You've probably had a teacher who taught you both the concepts of attention and focus, which in turn helped you understand the world around you.

## Class Features
 
### Harmony within Everything
 
As a sentinel, you know how to find peace and be able to concentrate on the world around you and on bettering yourself. During a short rest, you recover additional hit points equal to your sentinel level. In addition, you gain temporary hit points equal to your sentinel level whenever you finish a short or long rest.  
Furthermore, when a breakage level would apply to your unarmed strikes or natural armor, make a flat check with a DC equal to 11 - your sentinel level. If you succeed, the breakage level doesn't apply.
 
### Inner Focus
 
You have trained your mind to enter a state of coordination between body and mind. You have a number of charges called Focus, which you may use for different sentinel features. The maximum amount of focus you have is equal to your sentinel level. Half of this is regained when finishing a short rest, and all is recovered when finishing a long rest.  
You may use an action and 1 focus to become Focused, using your [[Reading a Spell Entry|concentration]] slot to allow the world around you to become clearer - you can control your senses more easily, focusing on whatever you'd like, your body is honed and prepared to deal with that which threatens it. While focused:

- You have a +1 bonus for Perception (Wisdom) checks.
- Your [[Weaponsmith#Commoners' Melee Weapons|unarmed strikes]] have their damage die increased by 1, and you may use all functional limbs in order to perform unarmed strikes and the [[Action Economy#^5d5dd0|shove]] brawl action. Gauntlet weapons are also affected by this bonus.
- Your natural armor AC increases by 1.
- You gain access to the Deflect reaction against an incoming attack, increasing your AC by half your Strength modifier against it. ^843c5c
- You have a +1 bonus to saving throws.

The focused condition lasts 10 minutes, and your concentration on it cannot end due to taking damage. You may also take a quick action right after the Focus action to make an unarmed strike.

### Grazing Style

Starting at 2nd level, you learn how to take advantage of your opponents getting dangerously close to you. An attack is considered _grazing_ whenever it misses you by an amount equal to the bonus AC you would get from using the [[#^843c5c|deflect]] reaction, even while not deflecting. Whenever a feature would increase your grazing range, the amount by which the attack misses can be greater.
Whenever an attack grazes you, your next [[Action Economy#^43d1b5|attack]] or [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl]] action against the attacker until the end of their next turn only takes a quick action to perform, without any penalty. 

>[!example]
>For a sentinel with 18 Strength and AC 16, the bonus from deflect would be +2. Therefore, grazing range is 2, meaning that without using deflect, attack rolls between 14-15 would be grazing, while with deflect 16-17 would be grazing. If the grazing range is then increased by 1, then attack rolls between 13-15 would be grazing, or 15-17 while deflecting.
>
>Maneuvers and other traits which would increase the deflect range modify this range as well.
### Martial Techniques
 
At 2nd level, you learn the use of [[Sign of Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]]. Whenever you gain this feature, you may use its preparation slots to prepare either techniques of this class or a general technique. You may choose to prepare a basic technique instead of an advanced technique if you fulfill its class requirements.
 
| **Sentinel** **Level** | **Basic Techniques** | **Advanced Techniques** |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2nd                    | 1                    | -                       |
| 4th                    | 2                    | -                       |
| 6th                    | 3                    | -                       |
| 8th                    | 3                    | 1                       |
| 10th                   | 3                    | 2                       |

### Attribute Increase
 
When you reach 2nd level, and again at: 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.

### Keen Observer * (also look at Dodge)

At 3rd level, your ability to study the battlefield allows you to take calculated risks, be it cognizant or instinctual. Up to once per round when you use the [[Action Economy#^047348|assess]] quick action, you may forgo learning up to 2 facts you would as a part of the quick action, and raise your graze range by the same amount.
You also gain 1 proficiency level in any skill of your choice.

### Enhanced Focus
 
At 4th level, you have managed to enhance your focus further. While focused, your unarmed strike damage die, the bonus you gain to Perception (Wisdom) checks and your natural armor AC increases by 1, in addition to your movement speed being increased by 5'.

### Focus Strikes
 
At 5th level level, you can use your focus in a concise strike that delivers a shockwave to the attacked creature. At the start of your turn, you may use 1 focus to empower your weapon attacks for the remainder of the turn, adding 1d6 force to your damage rolls. If you manage to hit with two focus strikes against the same creature during a turn, and they are of one size category above yours or lower, it must succeed on a Resilience saving throw against a DC equal to 10 + your Strength modifier + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency modifier, or become stunned until the end of their next turn.
 
### Stance
 
At 6th level, your training in the martial arts causes you to develop your practical memory to instinctively modify your [[#^843c5c|deflect]] reaction against grazing attacks as a part of the same deflect reaction. In addition, while focused, deflecting increases your grazing range by your deflect bonus. When you use an action to become [[#Inner Focus|focused]], you may choose one of the following stances, which lasts until your focus breaks:

- Stone Stance: If an attack grazes you while you [[Sentinel#Deflecting Instinct|deflect]], you may attempt to leverage their momentum to throw them off balance. They must make an Initiative save or fall prone. If they were already prone, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage instead.
- Mud Stance: If an attack grazes you while you [[Sentinel#Deflecting Instinct|deflect]], you attempt to strike their mental balance. They must make a Wits save or have their combat initiative decreased by 1d3.

You may also change your stance while focused as a quick action.  
In addition, you become proficient with Resilience and Initiative saving throws.
 
### Watchful Combatant
 
At 7th level, your mastery over yourselves and others shows in your reflexes and ability to manipulate a dangerous situation to your advantage. You become proficient with Willpower saving throws. In addition, whenever an enemy moves willingly within your reach for the first time each round, you may make an attack of opportunity against them with advantage. Doing this requires you to succeed on a Willpower save equal to your reaction DC just as a reaction would, but does not increase the DC.

### Deflection Expertise
 
At 8th level, your deflection skills are heightened to the point of being able to diminish any attack. Whenever you use the [[Sentinel#^843c5c|deflect]] reaction, you become resistant to the damage of the incoming attack.

### Mortal Reminder

At 9th level, the exposure to harm enhances your instincts, allowing you to rely on your inner focus to restore health. If an attack grazes you, during your next turn, you may use a quick action, 1 focus point and up to 2 hit dice in order to heal an amount of hit points equal to the result of those hit dice + twice the sum of your Constitution, Willpower and Wisdom modifier.
