## Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a trickster, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Dexterity 13.** Having decent speed and reflexes is important when attempting deeds in the dark.
- **Proficient with Sleight of Hand.** Trickster can execute actions deftly and skillfully, allowing them to execute tricks both on and away from the battlefield.
- **Novice with Deception.** Even if only a few easy verbal or bodily tricks, it's mandatory not to blow your cover when you least want to.
- **Complete special training.** Many people think they have the nimbleness required to be a trickster, but few actually do. Special training is mandatory in order to fully grasp even the elements of being a trickster, due to its complexity and the switch that has to be flickered in the mental grasp of pacing.

## Class Features
 
### Shifting Tempo
 
Tricksters are able to shift their tempo as combat goes on, in order to match their reflexes to other creatures and strike at the right time. Whenever you hit a creature with an attack, you may increase or decrease your combat initiative by up to half your Dexterity modifier. When attacking a surprised creature or a creature with the same initiative as you, you have +1 to your attack roll and add [[Weapon Rules#Lethal|lethal]] 1 to your attack. 
At 4th level, you get +2 to your attack and add [[Weapon Rules#Lethal|lethal]] 2 instead, and you may increase or decrease your initiative by up to half your Dexterity modifier +1 instead.

In addition, you may use the Dodge reaction as a response to being attacked by an enemy you can see. If you succeed, your AC is increased by your Dexterity modifier divided by 3 against the attack. ^26e047
 
>[!note] 
>You can't take two turns during the same round of combat, even if you lower your initiative.
### Cunning Action
 
Starting at 2nd level, you understand how some basic actions can be done in a much quicker manner using your speed. The [[Action Economy#^f8a635|dash]] and [[Action Economy#^284a7e|hide]] actions become quick actions for you.  
When you take the Dash action as a quick action, you may move up to half your speed instead of your full move speed, and when you take the Hide action as a quick action, you have a -2 penalty to your roll.  
### Martial Techniques
 
At 2nd level, you learn the use of [[Sign of Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]]. Whenever you gain this feature, you may use its preparation slots to prepare either techniques of this class or a general technique. You may choose to prepare a basic technique instead of an advanced technique if you fulfill its class requirements.

| **Trickster Level** | **Basic Techniques** | **Advanced Techniques** |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2nd                 | 1                    | -                       |
| 4th                 | 2                    | -                       |
| 6th                 | 3                    | -                       |
| 8th                 | 3                    | 1                       |
| 10th                | 3                    | 2                       |
### Fast Hands
 
Starting at 3rd level, your deftness and speed allows you to perform gentle tasks with great speed. The [[Action Economy#^30b3a9|major interaction]], [[Action Economy#^1e684d|disorient]] and [[Action Economy#^79c113|medicate]] actions become quick actions for you, and you gain a climbing speed equal to half your walking speed.  
When using the [[Action Economy#^1e684d|disorient action]] as a quick action, the target gets a +2 bonus their saving throw, and using the [[Action Economy#^79c113|medicate action]] as a quick action gives you a -2 penalty to your roll.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in either the Sleight of Hand or Medicine.
 
### Uncanny Tempo
 
At 4th level, your manipulation of tempo is refined so that you can take advantage of any situation. When you get this feature, choose either Strength or one of: Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma.

When you hit an attack against a surprised creature or a creature that rolled a lower combat initiative than you did, you may choose to add a bonus to your damage roll for that attack. Alternatively, when a creature that rolled a higher combat initiative than you did attacks and hits you, you may choose to give them a penalty on the damage roll for that attack.
If you chose Strength, the bonus and penalty are equal to your Strength modifier. Otherwise, they are equal to half your modifier for the attribute you chose.

You may only use this feature once per round. You may use this feature twice per round starting at 5th level, even on the same trigger.

### Quick Attack
 
Starting at 5th level, the [[Action Economy#^43d1b5|attack]] action becomes a quick action for you. Using a quick action to perform the Attack action does not allow you to use the [[Fighter#Extra Attack|extra attack]] fighter feature on it. 
In addition, your damage rolls with light, finesse and ammunition weapons increase by 1.
 
### Alacrity
 
As you reach 6th level, your body gets used more and more to moving across fields, avoiding any danger that comes near it. Your walking speed increases by 10', and you are not impeded by difficult terrain while using techniques which involve your movement or the [[Action Economy#^f8a635|dash action]].  
In addition, you become proficient with Initiative and Wits saving throws.
 
### Guerilla
 
At 7th level, you learn how to manage to get your attacks through even at tough situations. When you are supposed to attack with disadvantage, such as from being [[Brawling Conditions#Prone|prone]] or using a ranged weapon when only 5' away from your target, you may cancel 1 disadvantage to attack with a -2 penalty. This may be used only once per attack.  

In addition, whenever you attack a creature using a weapon without disadvantage, you may add 1d4 piercing damage to your damage roll. This damage die scales from the weapon's potency upgrade, so a +1 weapon would increase this piercing damage to 1d6, and so on. This may be used only once against each creature per round.
 
### Skillful Technique
 
At 8th level, you choose one technique out of your cunning actions which you stride with towards perfection. Choose two actions to become your skillful techniques: [[Action Economy#^1e684d|disorient]], [[Action Economy#^284a7e|hide]], [[Action Economy#^30b3a9|major interaction]], and [[Action Economy#^79c113|medicate]].

Whenever you successfully use one of your skillful techniques as a quick action, you increase your movement speed by 5' and your next damage roll until the end of your next turn by 1, and whenever you successfully use it as an action, including martial techniques which extend it to an action, you increase your speed by 10' and increase your next damage roll until the end of your next turn by 2.
 
### Versatile Rotation
 
At 9th level, your versatility improves while you perform many different actions during your flow. You gain the following benefits:

- If you didn't attack during the previous round with a melee weapon, your first melee weapon attack during a round deals one and a half times its normal damage.
- If you didn't attack during the previous round with a ranged weapon, your first ranged weapon attack during a round deals one and a half times its normal damage.
- If you didn't use the [[#Shifting Tempo|dodge reaction]] during the previous round, your first Dodge reaction during a round raises your AC by an additional 2.
 
### Perfected Technique
 
At 10th level, your mastery over one of your [[#Skillful Technique|skillful techniques]] rises to the point where you can instinctively perform it without wasting any extra time. Choose one of your skillful techniques. This becomes your perfected technique, and you may perform it once during your turn as a free action. This grants you the benefits of Skillful Technique as if you were using it as a quick action.
