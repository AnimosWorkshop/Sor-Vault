# Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a transmuter, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Intelligence 13.** You must be able to study both the world and the interactions between materials in order to understand how to extend your abilities to the physical limit.
- **Proficient with Alchemist.** The principals of compounding and transmuting allow for the transmuter to use their powers.
- **Novice with Athletics.** A good transmuter knows the limits of their own body in order to know how to break them without causing injuries to themselves.
- **Complete special training.** Anyone can be a researcher or an alchemist, but in order to be a true transmuter your alchemy needs to break the limit between

# Class Features
 
## Alchemechanical Infusion
 
Whenever you make a weapon attack, you can infuse your weapon to increase its potency, increasing the weapon's damage die by 1 for the attack.  
In addition, as a reaction to being attacked by a weapon, you may attempt to defuse the weapon. If you do, the weapon's damage die decreases by 1 for the attack.
 
## Makeshift Alchemy
 
As a professional alchemist, you possess the ability to make improvised tools which emulate the effects of other alchemical items. Once per long rest, you may spend half an hour create [alchemical items](Alchemist.md) under the Bombs, Harmful Substances and Concoctions tabs which cost up to 12 sc * your transmuter level for free, using materials from your surroundings as ingredients. These items deteriorate once you take your next long rest, or 16 hours pass.
 
## Alchemical Affinity
 
Your affinity with alchemy as both a profession and a way of life, increases as you improve in weaving it through battle.  
Starting at 2nd level, whenever you use your alchemechanical infusion to increase the damage die of a poison-coated weapon or a flask, you also increase the damage die dealt by the alchemical substance by 1.  
In addition, whenever a concoction would restore hit points to you, you gain additional hit points equal to your transmuter level.
 
## Far Thrower
 
Also starting at 4th level, whenever you attack with a thrown weapon, you may use Alchemechanical Infusion feature to instead double the weapon's range. Stacking this effect more than once makes the range: tripled, quadrupled, etc.
 
## Martial Techniques
 
At 2nd level, you learn the  use of [[Sign of Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]]. Whenever you gain this feature, you may use its preparation slots to prepare either techniques of this class or a general technique. You may choose to prepare a basic technique instead of an advanced technique if you fulfill its class requirements.
 
| **Transmuter Level** | **Basic Techniques** | **Advanced Techniques** |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2nd                  | 1                    | -                       |
| 4th                  | 2                    | -                       |
| 6th                  | 3                    | -                       |
| 8th                  | 3                    | 1                       |
| 10th                 | 3                    | 2                       |
 
## Attribute Increase
 
When you reach 2nd level, and again at: 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.
 
## Opus Creation Specialty
 
When you reach 3rd level, you create your major work as a transmuter, granting a fitting object of your choice with newfound powers. Choose one of the following opera, which becomes your opus. If the object is destroyed, you may remake the same opus on another fitting object of your choice during a short rest. You may also remake the opus onto another fitting object of your choice during a short rest, but this disables the opus on whatever it affected before.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in either Athletics, Acrobatics or Perception.
 
### Feather Fall Boots

While wearing these boots, your movement speed increases by 5', and you take half the fall damage you normally would.
 
### Heavy Strike Weapon

You modify a light or medium weapon's form and balance by adding 1 lb to its weight and increasing its weight category to the next one. The weapon's damage die is increased by 2.
 
### Personalized Fit Weapon

As long as you consciously wield this weapon, you cannot be disarmed from it against your will. As a result, you can also control the weapon better, increasing the weapon's lethal property by 1 while you wield it.
 
### Sure Sight Helmet

The helmet can switch between two modes: one according to your [[Vision|vision type]] (whether be it: lightvision, nullvision or darkvision), and one vision type lighter or darker than the one you have. While you put on the helmet, you may switch between these two modes using a quick action.
 
## Momental Attack
 
At 4th level, you understand how to stretch your gain of momentum to its limit, allowing you to swing with extreme force at the cost of your own health. As another option of an infusion, using your transmuter's Alchemechanical Infusion feature, you may get a +1 bonus to your attack roll.
 
## Advanced Infusion
 
Starting at 5th level, your infusions become more powerful, allowing you to infuse a weapon attack twice instead of once. The infusions may be the same infusion, or two different infusions.  
You may also apply a doubled effect when you defuse a weapon attack using your Alchemechanical Infusion feature using the same reaction.
 
## Vitality Transference
 
At 6th level, you unlock the ability to extract some of your own vital essence, and transform it into a drinkable fluid, which, when drunk, "redeems" the life energy as health. Once during a short rest, you may spend 10 minutes and expend any amount of hit dice in order to transfer the vital essence from yourself into a small water vial, which fills with a semi-translucent concoction. You may prepare any amount of vials this way during the rest, so long as each contains at least one hit die.
Any creature who drinks the concoction from the vial regains hit points equal to twice those hit dice + twice your Constitution modifier. If not used by the next 24 hours, the concoctions spoil.  
In addition, your body adapts to survive such operations by becoming more resilience - granting you proficiency in Resilience and Wits saving throws.
 
## Deeper Alchemical Affinity
 
At 7th level, the bonuses you get from the Alchemical Affinity feature are enhanced, allowing you to use alchemical items to an even more potent degree. Whenever you use your alchemechanical infusion to increase the damage die of a poison-coated weapon or a flask, you also increase the damage die dealt by the alchemical substance by 2 instead of by just 1. This applies only once per attack, so enhancing the attack's damage with two infusions increases the substance's damage die by 3.  
In addition, whenever a concoction would restore hit points to you, you gain additional hit points equal to your 1.5 times your transmuter level instead of once.
 
## Upgraded Opus Specialty
 
Also when you reach 7th level, you upgrade your opus in such a manner which enhances its capabilities to bestow you a greater benefit.
 
### Feather Fall Boots

While wearing these boots, your movement speed increases by an additional 10', and you take only quarter of the fall damage instead of half.
 
### Heavy Strike Weapon

The weapon's damage die is increased by an additional 2.
 
### Personalized Fit Weapon

The weapon's lethal property by an additional 1 while you wield it.
 
### Sure Sight Helmet

You have a +2 bonus for skill checks of the Search action while wearing the helmet, and you add the last mode to your helmet, allowing you to switch between: lightvision, nullvision and darkvision, using a quick action.
