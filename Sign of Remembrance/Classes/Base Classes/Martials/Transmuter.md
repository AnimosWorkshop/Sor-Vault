- **Intelligence 13.** You must be able to study both the world and the interactions between materials in order to understand how to extend your abilities to the physical limit.
- **Expert Alchemist.** The principals of compounding and transmuting allow for the transmuter to use their powers.
- **Novice with Athletics.** A good transmuter knows the limits of their own body in order to know how to break them without causing injuries to themselves.
- **Complete special training.** Anyone can be a researcher or an alchemist, but in order to be a true transmuter your alchemy needs to break the limit between

# Class Features
 
## Alchemechanical Infusion

As a transmuter, you gain access to alchemechanical infusions, which allow you to enhance the potency of certain actions. The number of infusions you can perform is equal to twice your proficiency modifier, and they are replenished at the start of your turn. This feature lists all the available infusion triggers a transmuter gets, along with their level requirement and effect. 

If a trigger notes it requires a reaction and you have the [[#Advanced Infusion]] feature, you spend only 1 reaction for all infusions for this trigger.

* On making a weapon attack:
	* Offensive Infusion (1st) - Increase the size of the weapon's damage die by 1.
	* Rapid Alchemical Enhancement (2nd) - If the weapon is an alchemical bomb or harmful flask, or is enhanced by an alchemical substance such as venoms or a crystallizer, increase the damage die of the substance by 1.
	* Precision Strike (4th) - Increase the attack roll by 1, and by an additional 1 if the enemy is [[Conditions#Grappled|grappled]], [[Conditions#Restrained|restrained]] or [[Conditions#Prone|prone]].
	* Biomechanical Catapult (4th) - If the weapon is thrown, increase its range by its original range increment (double for the first infusion, triple for the second, etc.)
* On being attacked by a weapon attack (requires a reaction):
	* Defensive Diffusion (1st)  - Decrease the size of the weapon's damage die by 1.
	* Adaptive Mold (5th, \*) - If the attack hits, after damage is dealt, gain resistance 1 against the highest dealt damage type.
* On being healed by a concoction or alchemical dart:
	* Alchemical Restoration (2nd) - Increase the size of each healing die by 1.
* On being forced to make a saving throw against a non-magical effect (requires a reaction):
	* Dissipative Force (5th, \*) - If you succeed on your save, the creature which forced you to make that save must use a quick action to recover, or take a -2 penalty to their imposed DC for the same action type for the next minute.
 
## Makeshift Alchemy
 
As a professional alchemist, you possess the ability to make improvised tools which emulate the effects of other alchemical items. Once per long rest, you may spend half an hour create [alchemical items](Alchemist.md) under the Bombs, Harmful Substances and Concoctions sections which cost up to 16 sc * your transmuter level for free, using materials from your surroundings as ingredients. These items deteriorate once you take your next long rest, or 16 hours pass.
 
## Martial Techniques
 
At 2nd level, you learn the use of [[Sign of Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]]. Whenever you gain this feature, you may use its preparation slots to prepare either techniques of this class or a general technique. You may choose to prepare a basic technique instead of an advanced technique if you fulfill its class requirements.
 
| **Transmuter Level** | **Basic Techniques** | **Advanced Techniques** |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2nd                  | 1                    | -                       |
| 4th                  | 2                    | -                       |
| 6th                  | 3                    | -                       |
| 8th                  | 3                    | 1                       |
| 10th                 | 3                    | 2                       |
 
## Attribute Increase
 
When you reach 2nd level, and again at: 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.
 
## Opus Creation
 
When you reach 3rd level, you create your major work as a transmuter, granting a fitting object of your choice with newfound powers. Choose one of the following opera, which becomes your opus. If the object is destroyed, you may remake the same opus on another fitting object of your choice during a short rest. You may also remake the opus onto another fitting object of your choice during a short rest, but this disables the opus on whatever it affected before.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in either Athletics, Acrobatics or Perception.
 
* _Feather Fall Boots_ - While wearing these boots, your movement speed increases by 5', and you take half the fall damage you normally would.
* _Heavy Strike Weapon_ - You modify a light or medium weapon's form and balance by adding 1 lb to its weight and increasing its weight category to the next one. The weapon's damage die is increased by 2.
* _Personalized Fit Weapon_ - As long as you consciously wield this weapon, you cannot be disarmed from it against your will. As a result, you can also control the weapon better, increasing the weapon's lethal property by 1 while you wield it.
* _Sure Sight Helmet_ - The helmet can switch between two modes: one according to your [[Vision|vision type]] (whether be it: lightvision, nullvision or darkvision), and one vision type lighter or darker than the one you have. While you put on the helmet, you may switch between these two modes using a quick action.
## Advanced Infusion
 
Starting at 5th level, your infusions become more powerful. Whenever you would be able to use an [[#Alchemechanical Infusion|alchemechanical infusion]], you may use two. You may use the same infusion twice for a doubled effect.
In addition, the infusions list contains some options marked by \*. These are advanced infusions, and you may use a total number of advanced infusions equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest.

## Vitality Transference
 
At 6th level, you unlock the ability to extract some of your own vital essence, and transform it into a drinkable fluid, which, when drunk, "redeems" the life energy as health. Once during a short rest, you may spend 10 minutes and expend any amount of hit dice in order to transfer the vital essence from yourself into a small water vial, which fills with a semi-translucent concoction. You may prepare any amount of vials this way during the rest, so long as each contains at least one hit die.
Any creature who drinks the concoction from the vial regains hit points equal to twice those hit dice + twice your Constitution modifier. If not used by the next 24 hours, the concoctions spoil.  
In addition, your body adapts to survive such operations by becoming more resilience - granting you proficiency in Resilience and Wits saving throws.
 
## Mutable Alchemy
 
At 7th level, you are able to create a mutable alchemical kit using your [[#Makeshift Alchemy|makeshift alchemy supplies]], made up of different substance which are only almost stabilized. When you prepare your makeshift alchemy supplies, choose an amount of gold up to 4 sc * your Transmuter level. This amount is subtracted from your supplies, and enters the mutable kit. Using a [[Action Economy#^359f07|minor interaction]], you are able to create one item from these materials, subtracting its cost from the amount of remaining materials.
When you take a long rest, any unused items and supplies deteriorate.

## Upgraded Opus
 
Also when you reach 7th level, you upgrade your [[#Opus Creation|opus]] in such a manner which enhances its capabilities to bestow you a greater benefit.
 
* _Feather Fall Boots_ - While wearing these boots, your movement speed increases by an additional 10', and you take only quarter of the fall damage instead of half.
* _Heavy Strike Weapon_ - The weapon's damage die is increased by an additional 2.
* _Personalized Fit Weapon_ - The weapon's lethal property by an additional 1 while you wield it.
* _Sure Sight Helmet_ - You have a +2 bonus for skill checks of the [[Action Economy#^3d44e8|search action]] while wearing the helmet, and you add the last mode to your helmet, allowing you to switch between: lightvision, nullvision and darkvision, using a quick action.
