## Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a fighter, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Strength or Dexterity 13.** Having a fit and able body is important for a fighter, as you maneuver and strike through the battlefield.
- **Proficient with light armor.** The importance of armor is immense on the battlefield, and can make the difference between a close miss and a fatal blow.
- **Novice with either Athletics or Acrobatics.** In addition to natural talent or physical capability, a fighter must also know how to best use their body at peak performance.
- **Complete special training.** Many people know weapon arts, but not all are prepared for a fighter's training. Those who become fighters learn special techniques and ways of fighting in order to become the skilled people they are.

## Class Features
 
### Parrying Strike
 
Starting at 1st level, your knowledge of the battlefield allows you to defend without fear. When you are attacked, you may use a parry reaction using a weapon or a shield. When you do, subtract half your fighter level + your Strength modifier divided by 3 (total minimum of 1) from the damage dealt.  
If the incoming attack critically hits, breakage is applied to the weapon or shield instead of your armor.
 
### Adrenaline Surge
 
Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to send a surge of adrenaline through your body. During your turn, you may use your quick action to execute an action, and regain an amount of hit points equal to 1d6 + your fighter level.  
You may use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so after you finish a short or long rest. You gain another use when you reach 7th level.
 
### Martial Techniques
 
At 2nd level, you learn the  use of [[Sign-of-Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]]. Whenever you gain this feature, you may use its preparation slots to prepare either techniques of this class or a general technique. You may choose to prepare a basic technique instead of an advanced technique if you fulfill its class requirements.
 
| **Fighter Level** | **Basic Techniques** | **Advanced Techniques** |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2nd               | 1                    | -                       |
| 4th               | 2                    | -                       |
| 6th               | 3                    | -                       |
| 8th               | 3                    | 1                       |
| 10th              | 3                    | 2                       |
   

### Ability Score Increase
 
When you reach 2nd level, and again at: 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
 
### Arms Specialty
 
When you reach 3rd level, choose a type of weapon to become your specialty weapon. Based on the category you choose, you get a bonus when using these types of weapons:
 
#### Hurler (sling, flask, dart, whip)
The Lethal property and the damage die for weapons of this specialty increases by 1 for you.
 
#### Pugilist (knuckles, unarmed strikes)
Parrying Strike can be used in conjunction with the Deflect reaction as a part of the same reaction if you are using a weapon of this specialty. If you don't have the Deflect reaction, you may instead increase your AC by 1 against the attack in addition to the normal effects of Parrying Strike.
 
#### Sharpshooter (blowgun, shortbow, stone bow, crossbow, hand crossbow, longbow)
You get a +2 bonus to attack rolls with weapons of this specialty.
 
#### Skewer (dagger, estoc, hook, javelin, knife, pike, rapier, rondel, shortsword, spear)
When you critically hit with a weapon of this specialty, it breaks the defender's armor no matter its type.
 
#### Sweeper (club, chain whip, greatclub, hammer, mace, quarterstaff, battleaxe, greatsword, halberd, war pickaxe)
You get a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapons of this specialty.
#### Swiftblade (bastard sword, sickle, handaxe, glaive, scimitar)
Whenever you attack with a weapon of this specialty, you may move 5' as a part of your attack action. Attacks of opportunity taken against you as a part of this movement are made with disadvantage.
 
### Weapon Adaptability
 
Also at 3rd level, whenever you attack with a weapon you are not proficient with, you may add half your proficiency modifier to the attack roll.  
You also gain 1 proficiency level in either the Intimidation or Performance.
 
#### Dirty Tactics
When everything goes loose, you must learn to take the reins and stir back to control. At 4th level, you choose a "dirty tactic" to adopt and add to your arsenal, from the following choices:
 
#### Choke
While using a two-handed weapon and grappling or restraining another creature, you may still use your weapon to make an attack with it with advantage, as you grapple the creature using your weapon. The attack's damage die is 1d6 bludgeoning.
 
#### Fling
You are able to throw weapons more effectively, increasing their range by 10' for the first increment, and by 20' for the second increment.
 
#### Shield Bash
While wielding a shield, you may use it as a weapon. It deals bludgeoning damage according to the shield's weight category (1d4 for light, 1d6 for medium, 1d8 for heavy), and you are considered proficient with it. If you are using a heavy shield, you may also shove the creature you are attacking with it as a free action.
 
#### Swift Grab
You may make a brawl action as a quick action, but doing so gives the target a +2 bonus to their Resilience saving throw.
 
### Extra Attack
 
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action as an action.
 
### On Guard
 
At 6th level, you learn how to use your weapon effectively not only as a means for offense, but for defense too. Expanding on what you have already learned with parrying, you may expend any number of attacks from your Attack action during it to perform a Guard. When you are damaged by an attack, the Guard is automatically activated, and you make a damage roll with your weapon. The damage you rolled is reduced from the damage of the attack.  
The amount of times you can guard equals to the number of attacks expended.  
In addition, you become proficient with Resilience and Willpower saving throws.
 
><u>Note:</u> The damage roll you make includes your ability modifier (Strength or Dexterity usually, depending on the weapon) and any other modifiers to damage you would have for that weapon's attacks.
 
### Arms Adept
 
Starting at 7th level, your knowledge about weapons expands to the point that you can wield any weapon. You add your full proficiency modifier to attacks with weapons you are not proficient with instead of half, and you add one and a half times your proficiency modifier instead of once to attacks with weapons of your specialty if you are proficient with them.  
In addition, you increase the damage die of weapons from your arms specialty weapon category by 1.
 
### Momentum
 
At 9th level, your mastery over battle allows you to chain your moves, dazing others as you sweep through. When you hit with the second weapon attack against creatures on your turn, you may use one of the following options as a follow-up free action:

- Move half your base movement speed without provoking attacks of opportunity
- Attempt to use a brawl action
- Increase your AC by 1 (if using a weapon which is neither light nor heavy) or by 2 (if using a heavy weapon) until the start of your next turn
- Increase the next attack roll by an ally against an enemy within 5' by your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (if using a light weapon)

You may only use this feature once per round.
 
### Specialty Mastery
 
At 10th level, you master your arms specialty wholly, allowing you to add twice your proficiency modifier to attack rolls with those weapons and increase the weapon's damage die by 1. In addition, you learn a special move depending on the specialty you chose, which you can attempt when you make a weapon attack with your specialty weapon once per round:
 
#### Hurler - Opening
The next attack against the target until the start of your next turn is made with advantage.
 
#### Pugilist - Uppercut
If the attack hits, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against 10 + your attack bonus or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
 
#### Sharpshooter - Headshot
The weapon's lethal property is increased by 2 for the attack, but you get a -2 penalty to the attack roll.
 
#### Skewer - Puncture
If the attack hits, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against 10 + your attack bonus or take 3d4 additional necrotic damage.
 
#### Sweeper - Bulldoze
If the attack hits, the target must make a Strength saving throw against 10 + your attack bonus or take 1d4 additional bludgeoning damage and be pushed back 10'.
 
#### Swiftblade - Outspeed
The target takes additional damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and you may move an additional 5' as a part of your attack.
