## Class Features
 
### Dirty Tactics

When everything goes loose, you must learn to take the reins and stir back to control. At 1st level, you choose a "dirty tactic" to adopt and add to your arsenal, from the following choices:

* _Careful Step_ - While you [[Action Economy#^665abd|disengage]], you may move through the space of unwilling creatures, given you have enough movement to spend to get to their other side. When you do, they may attempt an [[Action Economy#Opportunity Attacks|opportunity attack]] against you. Unless you are hit by the creature, you succeed in moving through their space. If you are hit, you still expend your movement but do not move, but may try again.
* _Choke_ - While grappling, restraining or toppling another creature, you may still use your weapon to make an attack with it with advantage, as you grapple the creature using your weapon. The attack's damage die has its size reduced by 1, but the weapon's traits remain the same. ^171e67
* _Mobile Retrieval_ - When within 5' from an unattended piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon you've thrown, you may use 5' of movement to pick it up with a free hand, once per round as a free action on your turn.
* _Shield Bash_ - While wielding a shield, you may use it as a weapon. It deals bludgeoning damage according to the shield's weight category (1d4 for light, 1d6 for medium, 1d8 for heavy). Proficiency with shield attacks is gained as part of your shield proficiency, and the weapon is considered of the pugilist style. ^96f2d9
* _Swift Grab_ - You may make a [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl action]] as a quick action, but doing so gives the target a +2 bonus to their Resilience saving throw. ^a688fd
### Parrying Strike
 
Starting at 1st level, your knowledge of the battlefield allows you to defend without fear. When you are attacked, you may use a parry reaction using a weapon or a shield. When you do, reduce your AC by 1, and subtract half your fighter level + your Strength modifier divided by 3 (rounding up applies to each separately; total minimum of 1) from the damage dealt.  
If the incoming attack critically hits, breakage is applied to the weapon or shield instead of your armor.
 
### Adrenaline Surge
 
Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to send a surge of adrenaline through your body. You may use your quick action to execute an action, and regain an amount of hit points equal to 1d6 + your fighter level.  
You may use this feature once, and regain the ability to do so after you finish a short or long rest. You gain another use when you reach 7th level.
 
### Martial Techniques
 
At 2nd level, you learn the use of [[Sign of Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]]. Whenever you gain this feature, you may use its preparation slots to prepare either techniques of this class or a general technique. You may choose to prepare a basic technique instead of an advanced technique if you fulfill its class requirements.
 
| **Fighter Level** | **Basic Techniques** | **Advanced Techniques** |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2nd               | 1                    | -                       |
| 4th               | 2                    | -                       |
| 6th               | 3                    | -                       |
| 8th               | 3                    | 1                       |
| 10th              | 3                    | 2                       |

### Arms Specialty
 
When you reach 3rd level, choose one weapon style to become your specialty. Based on the one you choose, you get a bonus when using these weapons:

* _Hurler_ - The [[Weapon Rules#Lethal|lethal]] trait and the damage die for hurler weapons increases by 1 for you.
* _Pugilist_ - [[#Parrying Strike|Parrying strike]] can be used in conjunction with the [[Sentinel#Inner Focus|deflect reaction]] as a part of the same reaction if you are using a pugilist weapon. If you don't have the [[Sentinel#Inner Focus|deflect reaction]], you may instead increase your AC by 1 against the attack in addition to the normal effects of [[#Parrying Strike|parrying strike]].
* _Sharpshooter_ - You get a +2 bonus to attack rolls with sharpshooter weapons.
* _Skewer_ - When you critically hit with a skewer weapon, it breaks the defender's armor no matter its type.
* _Sweeper_ - You get a +2 bonus to damage rolls with sweeper weapons.
* _Swiftblade_ - Whenever you attack with a swiftblade weapon, you may move 5' as a part of your attack action. [[Action Economy#Opportunity Attacks|Opportunity attacks]] taken against you as a part of this movement are made with disadvantage.
 
### Arms Lore
 
Also at 3rd level, your overall knowledge of arms allows you to intuit information about them, both theoretical and practical:
* During a short rest, you may examine a weapon or armor, even if they are not practical for use anymore such as due to being destroyed in a battle. Roll a [[Weaponsmith|weaponsmith]] or [[Armorer|armorer]] [[Crafting#^9f7299|knowledge check]] correspondingly and add half your fighter level to it, attempting to learn one of the following facts:
	* DC 12 - is this object modified or upgraded in any way?
	* DC 16 - was this weapon made locally, or is it of foreign design?
	* DC 16 - what was this weapon degree of use, and was it taken care of?
* Whenever you attack with a weapon you are not proficient with, you may add half your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. 
You also gain 1 proficiency level in either the Intimidation or Performance.
 
### Advanced Dirty Tactics

At 4th level, you may choose to either add a second [[#Dirty Tactics|dirty tactic]] to your arsenal, or improve your existing one with the following benefits:
* _Careful Step_ - If you are [[Action Economy#^284a7e|hidden]], you are also considered [[Action Economy#^665abd|disengaging]]. If you became hidden via a dice roll (such as a Stealth (Dexterity) check), then that roll is also used as your Acrobatics (Dexterity) roll.
* _Choke_ - The size of the weapon's damage die is not reduced as a result of this feature.
* _Mobile Retrieval_ - Your weapons' damage die is increased by 1 while throwing them. In addition, when missing an attack with a thrown weapon or ammunition, they fall 5' closer to you from the target.
* _Shield Bash_ - The shield's damage die is increased by 1.
* _Swift Grab_ - The Resilience DC against the quickened [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl action]] does not get a bonus.
### Extra Attack
 
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the [[Action Economy#^43d1b5|attack]] action as an action. Each of those can be swapped for a [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl action]] as per usual.
If both attacks were used as regular (non-[[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl]]) attacks, and both hit, the second attack deals only half damage.
The attacks do not have to be taken together, meaning that if you take the Attack action, the second attack can occur at any time until the end of your turn.

Taking two Attack actions with the help of [[#Adrenaline Surge]] allows you to halve your damage only from the third hitting attack in total instead.

>[!note]
>Halving the attack's damage only occurs if both attacks hit, which implies that if only one of them hits, regardless of whether it's the first or second, damage isn't reduced.
### On Guard
 
At 6th level, you learn how to use your weapon effectively not only as a means for offense, but for defense too. Expanding on what you have already learned with parrying, you may expend any number of attacks from your Attack action during it to perform a Guard. When you are damaged by an attack, the Guard is automatically activated, and you make a damage roll with your weapon. The damage you rolled is reduced from the damage of the attack.  
The amount of times you can guard equals to the number of attacks expended.  
In addition, you become proficient with Resilience and Willpower saving throws.
 
>[!note] 
>The damage roll you make includes your ability modifier (Strength or Dexterity usually, depending on the weapon) and any other modifiers to damage you would have for that weapon's attacks.

### Momentum
 
At 7th level, your mastery over battle allows you to chain your moves, dazing others as you sweep through. When you hit with the second weapon attack or [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl action]] against creatures on your turn, you may use one of the following options as a follow-up free action:

- Move half your base movement speed without provoking [[Action Economy#Opportunity Attacks|opportunity attacks]]
- Attempt to use a brawl action
- Increase your AC by 1 (if using a medium weapon) or by 2 (if using a heavy weapon) until the start of your next turn
- Increase the next attack roll by an ally against an enemy within 5' by your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (if using a light weapon)

You may only use this feature once per round.
### Arms Adept
 
Starting at 8th level, your knowledge about weapons expands to the point that you can wield any weapon. You add your full proficiency modifier to attacks with weapons you are not proficient with instead of half, and you add one and a half times your proficiency modifier instead of once to attacks with weapons of your specialty if you are proficient with them.  
In addition, you increase the damage die of weapons from your arms specialty weapon category by 1.
### Dirty Tactics Mastery

At 9th level, you become a master of manipulating every advantage you can muster. Choose one of the following:
* Add another [[#Dirty Tactics|dirty tactic]] to adopt out of the list.
* If you already have two dirty tactics, upgrade both into [[#Advanced Dirty Tactics|advanced dirty tactics]].
* If you already have a singular advanced dirty tactic, upgrade it as following:
	* _Careful Step_ - Successfully passing through a creature's space while you [[Action Economy#^665abd|disengage]] makes them pacified 1.
	* _Choke_ - A creature grappled, restrained or toppled by you is pacified 1.
	* _Mobile Retrieval_ - When within 5' of an enemy who had been hit by a piece of ammunition or thrown weapon, you may use a quick action to draw it from their body. This deals the weapon's damage, including your attribute bonus for an attack, as if you had thrown it.
	* _Shield Bash_ - Shields you use have their [[Weapon Rules#Lethal|lethal]] trait increased by 1.
	* _Swift Grab_ - While grappling, restraining or toppling a creature, you have a +1 bonus to your damage rolls and AC.
### Specialty Mastery
 
At 10th level, you master your arms specialty wholly, allowing you to add twice your proficiency modifier to attack rolls with those weapons and increase the weapon's damage die by 1. In addition, you learn a special move depending on the specialty you chose, which you can attempt when you make a weapon attack with your specialty weapon once per round:

* _Opening_ (Hurler) - The next attack against the target until the start of your next turn is made with advantage.
* _Concussion_ (Pugilist) - If the attack hits, the target must make a Resilience saving throw against 10 + your attack bonus or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
 * _Headshot_ (Sharpshooter) - The weapon's [[Weapon Rules#Lethal|lethal]] trait is increased by 2 for the attack, but you get a -2 penalty to the attack roll.
 * _Puncture_ (Skewer) - If the attack hits, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against 10 + your attack bonus or take 3d4 additional necrotic damage.
 * _Bulldoze_ (Sweeper) - If the attack hits, the target must make a Resilience saving throw against 10 + your attack bonus or take 1d4 additional bludgeoning damage and be pushed back 10'.
 * _Outspeed_ (Swiftblade) - The target takes additional damage equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and you may move an additional 5' as a part of your attack.
