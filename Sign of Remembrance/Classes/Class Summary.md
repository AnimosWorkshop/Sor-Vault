## Base and Prestige Classes

Classes are where the bulk of functional character abilities comes from. After a character gains a level, they may choose which class to take for that level. Classes have a set of requirements which must be fulfilled to take a level in them.

>[!example] Example - Fighter Prerequisites
>![[Fighter#Prerequisites]]

Alongside the _base classes_, which can be taken starting from 1st level, there are _prestige classes_ to require characters to already have some levels taken in other classes.

>[!example] Example - Nullifier Prerequisites
>![[Nullifier#Prerequisites]]
>Therefore, a character can become nullifier at least when they reach 6th level, and after taking at least 2 levels as a trickster already.

It is thus clear that there is no requirement for characters to take levels in only one class: each level makes for a separate decision; however, class features do tend to become more powerful at higher levels, so spreading too thin is a risk as well.

## Martial Classes

Martial classes get their power from utilizing the capability of their own body to the maximum, and by using the tools around them to make the best out of every situation. While possessing no magic, they make up for it with consistency, which can define and defy the tide of battle.

To do so, martial classes gain access to [[Sign of Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]], which modify basic [[Action Economy|actions]], and always-available defensive reactions which enhance their durability on the battlefield.

### Base Classes

* [[Fighter]] - Using [[Fighter#Dirty Tactics|dirty tactics]] to brawl and bite through any situation, fighters can set up the circumstances to suit their playstyle and adapt. In addition, they can specialize in a specific [[Fighter#Arms Specialty|arms style]], which makes even their basic attacks more powerful.
* [[Sentinel]] - Using real-time insight about their opponents, sentinels [[Sentinel#Inner Focus|focus]] to hone their body and mind, and be able to take calculated risks via [[Sentinel#Grazing Style|grazing]], putting them closer to their opponents to strike quickly.
* [[Transmuter]] - Using daily crafted [[Transmuter#Makeshift Alchemy|alchemical items]], transmuters are versatile and can apply the right tool, or bomb, to the job. They also use physical understanding to [[Transmuter#Alchemechanical Infusion|alchemechanically infuse]] their attacks and diffuse their opponents.
* [[Trickster]] - Using their sharp mind, tricksters act so fast they almost seem to be masters of time itself. Being able to manipulate their [[Trickster#Shifting Tempo|timing]] and [[Trickster#Cunning Action|quicken their actions]], tricksters are able to squeeze the utmost efficiency out of every moment.

### Prestige Classes

* [[Partisan]] - Using their [[Partisan#Battle Trance|battle trance]], partisans are able to turn any small success into a whopping victory, gaining momentum as battle goes.
* [[Nullifier]] - Using their understanding, but not necessarily use of sorcery, nullifiers are able to stop casters in their place, either by [[Nullifier#Spell Breaker|breaking their spells]] or by [[Nullifier#Preemptive Disruption|preventing them]] before they happen.

## Caster Classes

Magic is a special and beautiful art, whose users may [[Learning Spells|learn to use]] in a way which suits them to give them a surge of advantage in that battlefield. Fittingly, while casters do get abilities which they can use outside of spells, their main power stems from being able to unleash those powerful spells at the time of need.

The three types of magic are: [[Arcana]], manipulating space and drawing matter and energy from the arcane web; [[Auramancy]], manipulating the living aura of creatures and biological processes; and [[Histolecty]], manipulating the social and emotional bonds between creatures.

Masters of magic over the history have divided between two categories: the specialists, which tend to favor the study of primarily one school of magic to perfect their knowledge in it and perhaps even create spells of their own with enough experience, and the generalists, which prefer a wider view of magic by not committing to any one school. Either path can be used to great effect.

### Base Classes

* [[Druid]] - Specializing in [[Auramancy|auramancy]], druids channel their power through nature, choosing whether to use it to [[Druid#Natural Specialty|protect or traverse]] and sustain their own body and others'.
* [[Mentalist]] - Specializing in [[histolecty]], mentalists manipulate their bonds to other creatures to either [[Mentalist#Mental Specialty|learn or influence]], and aid their group in battle.
* [[Wizard]] - Specializing in [[arcana]], wizards use their [[Wizard#Arcane Orb Specialty|arcane orb]] to channel and use more effectively a magic school of their choice, and be able to [[Wizard#Arcane Eye|instinctively recognize magic]] to defend against it.
* [[Paragon]] - Channeling the power of an [[Paragon Ideals.canvas|ideal]] of their choice, paragons study a magic type of their choice, and are able to use it to either [[Paragon#Intervention Specialty|disrupt or guide]] others.

### Prestige Classes

* [[Metamage]] - Being already professional casters, metamages hone their intuitive understanding of practical magic to manipulate both their own spells and their opponents' to [[Metamage#Reckless Casting|quicken]] or [[Metamage#Sorcerous Annihilation|counteract]] magic.
