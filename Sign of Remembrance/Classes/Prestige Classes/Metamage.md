## Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a metamage, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Constitution 13.** To withstand the deteriorating effects of magic upon one's body, a high physical tolerance is required.
- **Expert with Sorcery.** Metamages do not necessarily specialize in any particular magic type, but they know the theory to all - what drives them, and how to manipulate them.
- **5th level character.** Unlocking the true potential of sorcery requires extensive research not only by book, but by foot as well, as metamages deal with applied magic.
- **3rd level caster (combined).** No matter what magic type the metamage uses, they must be confident enough in their abilities to execute manipulations over traditional casting.
- **Complete special training.** Going around casting spells is one thing, but understanding the hidden depths and nuances is another matter entirely. Some guided perspective, both about the theory and application of this science, is well-needed.

## Class Features
 
### Mage
 
You continue your research of sorcery and spellcasting. For each of your metamage levels, you gain a caster level in any one magic type you already have.  
>[!example]
>A druid 3rd / wizard 2nd / metamage 1st can only choose to gain either auramancer or arcanist levels.
 
### Reckless Casting
 
As a metamage, your knowledge of spells allows you to throw spells in a less powerful form in exchange for casting speed. You may use this feature to cast a spell with a casting time of an action as a quick action instead. If you do:

- If the spell requires an attack to be made, it is made with disadvantage.
- If the spell requires the target to make a saving throw, they have advantage on the save.
- If the spell requires neither, the effect is halved.
- If the spell's effect can't be halved, the duration is halved.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier. The amount of uses recharges after a short or long rest.
 
### Sorcerous Annihilation
 
At 2nd level, you learn the principle of nullification by applying magic negative to one that affects you. While you are affected by a curse lasting 24 hours or less, you may use your action and spend a spellcasting (for example: resonance, influence, mana, etc.) of the same level as that curse in order to end that curse, and gain temporary hit points equal to five times the curse's level. If that curse was of the same type you had used, you gain temporary hit points equal to ten times the curse's level instead.

In addition, you have a bonus to saving throws against spell effects equal to half your metamage level, rounded up.
 
### Attribute Increase
 
When you reach 2nd level, and again at 4th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.
 
### Sorcerous Overload
 
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to infuse your spells with additional power using a quick action and making the somatic and verbal components as if you were casting a spell. Spend spell currencies up to that of 3rd level. For each spell level spent this way, the next spell you cast within the next minute is cast with a +1 bonus to your spellcasting modifier. This effect does not stack with itself.
 
### Magical Tolerance
 
At 4th level, your knowledge over magic has reached a point of being able to resist familiar magic. You get a bonus to saving throws against spells equal to the highest level of spells you are able to cast of that spell's magic type according to class levels only, disregarding any special abilities such as from your race. If the spell is a compound spell, use the lowest bonus available from this feature of the spell's magic types.  
In addition, when you roll a saving throw against any spell and the result exceeds the DC by at least 10, the spell does not affect you in any way. You can choose to ignore this effect.
 
### Dynamicist
 
Somehow, you have managed to break the limit - being so used to magic, containing and conducting so much energy and studying the laws and properties of dynamics all around you, lead you to not only the discovery - but the application, of magic beyond traditional mortal understanding. At 5th level, your caster level in all spellcasting types you are proficient with, is increased by 1.
 
>[!note] 
>If this feature would cause a character to be a 21th level caster of any magic type, they remain a 20th level caster but get a +1 bonus to their spellcasting bonus with that magic type.
