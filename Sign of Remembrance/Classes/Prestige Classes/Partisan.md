- **3rd level character.** Becoming a partisan requires an already-present combat experience, in order to learn from that and advance in their training.
- **Adept with Insight.** Without much time to think, partisans are often forced to make quick choices and assess their enemies in order to find an opportunity to turn the corner and become victorious.

## Class Features
### Battle Trance
 
As a quick action, you may let the thrill wash over you and enter into a battle trance. For the next minute, whenever you receive damage, reduce the amount taken by your partisan level divided by 3. This effect ends early if you are unconscious, or you end your turn without attempting to damage an enemy creature, performing a [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl action]] against an enemy creature, taking damage from an enemy creature, or casting a spell.  
You may use this feature twice, and regain all uses when you finish a short or long rest. You gain an additional use per rest at 4th level.
### Spree
 
Staying in your battle trance allows you further focus on the battle, and use your momentum to your advantage. You have a minimum spree of 0, and a maximum spree of 3 times your partisan level. Different events will allow you to gain, lose or spend spree, as follows:
#### Gaining Spree
- Hitting with a weapon attack (+1)
- Successfully performing a [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl action]] (+1)
- Rolling over a natural 18 on a martial technique's skill check (+1) 
- Rolling maximum damage on your weapon damage die (+2)
- Critically hitting with a weapon attack (+2)
- Dealing a killing blow (+3, overrules other spree-gaining methods)
#### Losing Spree
- Falling prone (-1)
- Critically missing with an attack (-2)
- Battle Trance ends (back to 0 spree)
#### Spending Spree
- Nullifying 1 disadvantage on a weapon attack before rolling (-1 each)
- Raising the damage rolled on a weapon attack by your proficiency modifier (-1)
- Using the Dash action as a quick action (-2)
- Raising the [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl action]] DC by 4 for your target as a quick action (-2, doesn't stack)
- Raising the number rolled on a weapon attack roll by 2 after rolling, potentially making the attack hit or critically hit (-3, doesn't stack, nullifies spree gain for the attack)
- Replenish 1 use of Battle Trance (-3)    
### Brutal Strikes

Starting at 2nd level, whenever you critically strike an enemy creature in Battle Trance, you deal additional damage to it equal to your partisan level.
In addition, you may take a calculated risk while in Battle Trance, giving your attacks have the potential to become lethal at the cost of your own safety. At the start of your turn, you may choose to assume a lethal stance until the start of your next turn. While in this stance, any attacks you make (including spell attacks) gain the Lethal 1 trait, but attacks against you also get the Lethal 1 trait.
### Martial Techniques
 
At 2nd level, you learn the use of [[Sign of Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]]. Whenever you gain this feature, you may use its preparation slots to prepare either techniques of this class or a general technique. You may choose to prepare a basic technique instead of an advanced technique if you fulfill its class requirements.

| **Partisan Level** | **Basic Techniques** | **Advanced Techniques** |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2nd                | 1                    | -                       |
| 4th                | 2                    | -                       |
| 6th                | 2                    | 1                       |
### Rejuvenating Flow
 
At 3rd level, you learn how to harness the flow of battle to regain your resolve. Whenever you gain spree, you recover twice as many hit points.
### Overexertion
 
At 4th level, you learn a way to extend your aggression beyond what is normally advised, entering more and more into your battle trance at the cost of your health. Whenever you gain spree, you may use up to 2 hit dice in order to gain an equal amount of additional spree.
### Retaliation
 
Starting at 5th level, as a reaction to being attacked, you may make a weapon attack against the enemy who attacked you. You may only use this feature once per round.  
In addition, you are proficient with Resilience and Willpower saving throws.
### Ever-Determined Spirit
 
When you reach 7th level, your resolve is unbreakable past the point of reason, allowing you to resist what would be otherwise deadly to you and come back from impossible situations. Whenever you would be reduced below 0 hit points for the first time after a short or long rest, make a Willpower saving throw with a DC equal to half the amount of damage exceeding 0 hit points. On a success, you return to 1 hit point, enter battle trance if you haven't already, and gain 10 spree.  
In addition, you need to fail an additional death saving throw in order to die.
