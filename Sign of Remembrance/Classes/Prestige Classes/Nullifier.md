## Prerequisites
 
In order to advance as a nullifier, you must meet the following prerequisites:

- **Wisdom 13.** Understanding the way of people, quickly assessing situations and focusing on the right things are mandatory to be a good nullifier.
- **Adept with Sorcery.** Nullifiers must have a better understanding of the concepts of magic than the mages they face in order to execute their job properly.
- **5th level character.** Not all can become proper nullifiers, and those who do must have preexisting experience with dangerous situations and the like.
- **2nd level Trickster.** Nullifiers require deft hands and cunning minds in order to operate cleanly and swimmingly. Tricksters often have the required skillset from the get-go, and are able to catch the principles of nullifiers quickly and efficiently.
- **Complete special training.** People do not wake up one day and decide to become nullifiers; they must be trained by an individual already familiar with the arts, in order to learn about the hidden truth of magic disruption.

## Class Features
 
### Discerning Mind
 
Your experience and keen mind help you deal more efficiently with illusion and coaxing magic. You gain the ability to use the Repel reaction as a response to being subjected to make a saving throw. If you succeed, you get a bonus to your saving throw equal to your Wisdom modifier divided by 3.  
In addition, when you use the Dodge reaction against spell attacks, your AC increases by an additional 1 against the attack.
 
### Preemptive Disruption
 
Starting at 2nd level, you are able to distinguish and react quickly to the act of casting spells, in order to prevent threats as soon as they are found. Using 2 reactions against a medium or heavy weapon attack or spell being cast within 5’ of you, you may attempt to disrupt the creature by making a melee weapon attack against them. If you hit, the attack deals 1d6 additional force damage.  
Remember that damaging a caster while a spell is being cast provokes a Resilience check to maintain the spell's casting.
 
### Martial Techniques
 
At 2nd level, you learn the use of [[Sign of Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]]. Whenever you gain this feature, you may use its preparation slots to prepare either techniques of this class or a general technique. You may choose to prepare a basic technique instead of an advanced technique if you fulfill its class requirements.
 
| **Nullifier Level** | **Basic Techniques** | **Advanced Techniques** |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2nd                 | 1                    | -                       |
| 4th                 | 1                    | 1                       |

### Silencing Strike
 
Starting at 3rd level, whenever you successfully hit a creature with a melee attack, you can force the creature to make a Resilience saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Sorcery (Wisdom) modifier. The creature loses the ability to use reactions until the start of their next turn, and takes additional damage equal to your Sorcery (Wisdom) modifier. On a failed save, the creature takes 1 exhaustion level in a magic type of your choice.  
You may attempt to use this feature an amount of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and regain uses when you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 5th level with this class, the amount of uses increases to double your Wisdom modifier instead.
 
### Spell Breaker
 
Starting at 4th level, your understanding of magic allows you to attempt to stop ongoing magical effects. When you touch a creature or object under the effects of an ongoing spell or magical effect, either as an action or when you hit with a melee attack, you may select one boon affecting the target. Make an Sorcery (Wisdom) check against a DC of 15 + double the level of the boon. On a successful check, the effect is dispelled.  
You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. All uses are replenished after you take a long rest.
 
### Reflexive Analysis
 
When you reach 5th level, your training of fighting against spells allows you to analyze mid-battle spells being cast on you and have the ability to fend against them. Whenever you are a target of or within the area of effect of a spell that you can see being cast within 60’ of you, you may use your reaction to attempt an Sorcery (Wisdom) check against a DC of 10 + the level of the spell being cast. If you succeed, you gain advantage on the saving throw against the spell, or the spell attack is made with disadvantage against you.  
In addition, you become proficient with Initiative and Willpower saving throws.
