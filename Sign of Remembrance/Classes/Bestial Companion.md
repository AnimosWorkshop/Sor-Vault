## Rulings
 
A bestial companion functions as a character separate from its master, and no actions are required to control them. Bestial companions are fundamentally different than normal beasts, as they've been trained in a particular way which causes their attributes to behave in a particular way. Such companions are usually at the same level as their masters, though they can only get bestial companion class levels.

## Class Features
 
### Bestial Proportions
 
The beast starts rather weak, and grows up as its level increases:

- The beast's size may be up to Small at 1st level, up to Medium at 4th level, and up to Large at 7th level.
- Its movement speeds are 25' walking, and 15' for other movement types which might fit it (such as flying or climbing), each increasing by 10' at 4th and 8th level.
- The beast has either lightvision, darkvision or nullvision, depending on their type.
- The beast's natural weapon is either based on Strength or on Dexterity. The Strength weapon deals 1d8 damage, and the Dexterity weapon deals 1d6 damage but has the Finesse property. The damage type is according to the attack's nature, between: Slashing, Bludgeoning and Piercing. This weapon damage increases when the beast becomes Large, as per usual.
- The beast has one of the following natural armor AC calculations:
    - Light - 10 + Dexterity modifier + half proficiency bonus (rounded up).
    - Medium - 13 + half Dexterity modifier + half proficiency bonus (rounded up).
    - Heavy - 16 + half proficiency bonus (rounded up).
 
### Bestial Evolution
 
As the companion levels up, it becomes more capable in the actions it can take. At 2nd level and on each level thereafter, the beast gains 1 proficiency level in any skill.
 
### Instinctual Action
 
Starting at 2nd level, the beast learns how to use one action faster than usual. Choose one of the following actions, which may be used as a quick action instead: [[Action Economy#^f8a635|dash]], [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl]], [[Action Economy#^1e684d|disorient]] (does not count as having a free hand), [[Action Economy#^284a7e|hide]].
 
### Attribute Increase
 
When the beast reaches 2nd level, and again at: 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.
 
### Striking Style
 
At 3rd level, the beast gains benefits to its natural weapon according to its nature. Choose one of the following:
 
#### Hunting Dance
Whenever the beast attacks it jumps from side to side, leaping to its next target. It may move 5' as a part of its attack action. [[Action Economy#Opportunity Attacks|Opportunity attacks]] taken against it as a part of this movement are made with disadvantage.
 
#### Sharp Fangs
When the beast critically hits with its bite, it breaks the defender's armor no matter its type.
 
#### Wild Thrasher
When the beast attacks with its limbs or body, it gets a +1 bonus to damage rolls.
 
### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, the beast can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the Attack action as an action.
