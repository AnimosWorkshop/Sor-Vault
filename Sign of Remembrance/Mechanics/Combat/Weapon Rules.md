## Weapon Damage Dice
 
Many features refer to either increasing or decreasing damage dice. Damage dice size can be described in the following chart:
 
0 $\rightarrow$ 1 $\rightarrow$ 1d2 $\rightarrow$ 1d3 $\rightarrow$ 1d4 $\rightarrow$ 1d6 $\rightarrow$ 1d8 $\rightarrow$ 1d10 $\rightarrow$ 1d12 $\rightarrow$ 2d6 $\rightarrow$ 2d8 $\rightarrow$ 2d10 $\rightarrow$ 3d8 $\rightarrow$ 3d10 $\rightarrow$ 4d8 $\rightarrow$ 3d12 $\rightarrow$ 6d6 $\rightarrow$ 5d8 $\rightarrow$ 7d6 $\rightarrow$ 4d12 $\rightarrow$ 5d10 $\rightarrow$ 5d12
 
It is easy to tell that as damage dice increase, they eventually get to a hard stop with 24 maximum damage. What increases, then, is consistency, as rolling more than 1 die results in rolls skewed more towards the middle, meaning they are more consistent.
 
As a creature and their weapons, increase in size, the amount of damage dice they roll increase with them. For each size category above Medium, the creature gains an additional damage die. For example, a large greatsword wielded by a large creature deals 4d6 base damage.
### Nonlethal Attacks
 
Weapons can also be used to use nonlethal attacks, meaning that if it reduces the creature's health to 0, they will render the creature stable, instead of dead or in need to roll death saving throws. In order to do so, the weapon must deal bludgeoning damage.
 
As a general note, all weapons have a way they can be used to deal 1d3 base bludgeoning damage in melee range, but those attacks are made as if it is a weapon you are not proficient with, meaning most times you won't add your proficiency modifier to it.

## Weapon Traits

#### Ammunition

You can use a weapon that has the ammunition trait to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack, but note that you need a second hand to load a weapon even if it is one-handed (as long as the second hand is able to function, even if that hand holds a shield or weapon, it is able to reload the weapon, but that item is not usable while you load your ammo).

#### Breaks on Contact

The weapon has a chance of breaking when it forcefully hits either a creature (in case of a hit), or a solid object (usually in case of a miss). If a DC is mentioned, the attacker may attempt a [[Dice Rolls#Flat Checks|flat check]] with the specified DC to prevent it from breaking.
#### Fragile

The weapon breaks more easily than other weapons, meaning that your critical miss range increases by this property's potency, indicated by the number next to this property's name. For example, a weapon with the Fragile 1 property (such as darts) breaks on a natural 1 and on a natural 2 on attack rolls with it.  
If a weapon's total Lethal and Fragile traits exceed 18 (since every weapon critically hits or misses on natural 20's and 1's in the first place), subtract 1 from each until their sum doesn't exceed 18 anymore. For example, a weapon with Lethal 24 and Fragile 8 will effectively be with Lethal 17 (= 24 - 7) and Fragile 1 (= 8 - 7), meaning that it will critically miss on a natural 2 or below, and critically hit on a natural 3 or higher.
### Finesse

When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
#### Glove

A glove weapon is worn on your hand or forearm, and you cannot be disarmed of it. You can hold objects, wield weapons, and cast spells with a hand fitted with a glove weapon, but you can only attack with the glove weapon (or get an AC boost from a shield with this trait) if that hand is unoccupied. It takes an major interaction to don or doff a glove object.
#### Lethal

The weapon strikes effectively more easily than other weapons, meaning that your critical hit range increases by this property's potency, indicated by the number next to this property's name. For example, a weapon with the Lethal 1 property critically hits on a natural 20 and on a natural 19 on attack rolls with it.  
If a weapon's total Lethal and Fragile traits exceed 18 (since every weapon critically hits or misses on natural 20's and 1's in the first place), subtract 1 from each until their sum doesn't exceed 18 anymore. For example, a weapon with Lethal 24 and Fragile 8 will effectively be with Lethal 17 (24 - 7) and Fragile 1 (24 - 7), meaning that it will critically miss on a 2 or below, and critically hit on a 3 or higher.
#### Natural

Natural weapons are a part of one's body, meaning that the individual cannot be disarmed from them.
#### Pommel

The weapon has a natural pommel which you are proficient with, meaning you add your proficiency modifier as normal to weapon attacks with it. The pommel deals 1d3 (light weapons), 1d4 (medium weapons) or 1d6 (heavy weapons) bludgeoning damage and has the finesse, light or heavy weight categories if the weapon has them.
#### Propulsive

A ranged weapon with the propulsive trait has a string which needs to be drawn, meaning that the power the weapon gets stems from the user's strength. Weapons with this trait use Strength instead of Dexterity for the purposes of attack and damage rolls.
#### Range

A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.
#### Reach

This weapon adds 5' to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.
#### Recourse

A property given to ranged weapons to indicate that they can also be used in melee range. When using them in melee range, the damage dealt is indicated by the number in the parentheses.  
Note that some weapons need to be loaded while using this property in order to attack, for example - the sling.
#### Thrown

If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack using your Strength modifier. If the weapon also has the Finesse property, you may throw it using your Dexterity modifier, so if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity. Thrown weapons which aren't melee weapons cannot be used effectively to attack in melee range.
#### Tool

The weapon can also be used as a tool, enhancing your abilities in a particular skill. The skill will be noted in parentheses next to this keyword, and you have a +1 bonus to that skill's checks and DCs as long as you hold it. This bonus does not stack if you hold multiple Tool objects.
#### Two-Handed

This weapon requires two hands to hold and attack with it.
#### Versatile

This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property - the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack. Spellcasters might choose to use versatile weapons, since they allow spellcasting while holding the weapon in 1 hand, then transitioning to 2 hands when attacking with the weapon.
#### Windup

This weapon can be wound up using a quick action. Doing so allows an Attack action to be made using it with only a quick action. Hitting with a wound up weapon in any way or becoming unable to move cancels the windup.

## Weight Categories

### Light

A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons: after you attack with a light weapon on your turn, you can use your quick action to attack with another light weapon.
 
### Medium

Medium items are "standard-size", meaning that there are no unique rules to handling them.
 
### Heavy

A heavy item takes more effort to handle with interaction actions, as noted in the Action Economy page.

## Weapon Breakage
 
When you critically miss with a weapon attack, it gains 1 breakage level. Each breakage level causes a -1 penalty to your attack and damage rolls until repaired. A weapon can have up to 3 breakage levels, as noted by the following list. Critical miss is normally only happens when you roll a natural 1 on your weapon attack, but traits such as Fragile may add to that range, meaning that they could miss on rolls higher than 1 too.  
Repairing a weapon requires an artisan with tools according to the type of weapon, and the price depends on the breakage level:

- Breakage 0 - None. The weapon is perfectly fine.
- Breakage 1 - 10% of the original price of the weapon. The weapon shows a minor decrease in performance.
- Breakage 2 - 20% of the original price of the weapon. The weapon shows a major decrease in performance.
- Breakage 3 - The weapon cannot be repaired. The weapon is broken, and cannot be used effectively, meaning that your proficiency modifier does not apply to it when attacking in addition to the normal -3 penalty for attack rolls. The weapon also does not have any of the traits it normally does, including upgrades ones, except for Light and Heavy.

The amount of time required to repair the weapon is 1 hour per base AC of the armor.
