Each creature in Sign of Remembrance has a set amount of maximum hit points, which represents both their physical fortitude (constitution) and mental fortitude (willpower). Damage dealt or loss of hit points may eventually result in dropping to 0 hit points or below it, which might lead to becoming unconscious, and possibly even character death. With both player characters and non-player characters, tracking hit points is important in order to assess the balance of forces, and the flow of an adventure.

## Temporary Hit Points
 
Temporary hit points are counted separately from regular hit points, and represent a ward the creature in question has. It mostly occurs in magical effects, such as the Heroic Verse histolecty spell, and is special because any damage dealt to that creature is first taken from the temporary hit points, and only then the remainder goes to the normal hit points pool. That also means, in turn, that damage dealt to temporary hit points alone does not provoke a concentration check from spellcasters, but nor does it help in stabilizing an unconscious creature.
 
Temporary hit points do not stack, and the creature receiving them may choose the source from which they want to keep them (will mostly be either the highest amount or the longest remaining). As hinted by the name, temporary hit points are temporary - they cannot be recovered by health-restoring spells, items and features and the like, and are lost as soon as the effect granting them ends.

## Damage and Loss of Hit Points
 
While both of these terms results in their current hit points going down, a key difference is that damage can be resisted, while loss of hit points cannot, with the second being that temporary hit points do not protect from loss of hit points. Damage is the more common of the two, and can be caused by almost anything. The damage types are as follows:

* Physical: ^542f8c
	* Bludgeoning - the knocking of a hard material against a creature
	* Piercing - a sharp focused blow able to go through a target
	* Slashing - sharp objects cutting through the target
* Elemental: ^af021a
	* Acid - chemical damage
	* Cold - a cold change of temperature
	* Fire - a hot change of temperature
	* Lightning - electrocution damage
	* Necrotic - biotic damage caused by harming a creature's systems
* Kinetic - a strong vibrational force
* Sensory - overload to the senses of the target, be it sight, hearing or cognition

Creatures can be: weak, resistant or immune to certain damage types, as described in their racial / class / items page or creature stats page.
 
- Weakness - stacks up to twice per damage type. The creature takes 25% more damage from that damage type, or 50% more if stacked twice.
- Resistance - stacks up to twice per damage type. The creature takes 25% less damage from that damage type, or 50% less if stacked twice.
- Immunity - the creature takes 0 damage from that damage type.
 
The number 2 written next to a weakness or resistance indicates double weakness or double resistance, respectively.  
In contrast to damage, whose numbers can be manipulated, loss of hit points is extremely rare, and cannot be prevented or augmented in any way. These are effects which directly pull out of a character's life force.

#### Fall Damage

When finishing to fall, a creature takes 1d8 kinetic damage for each 10' of height difference from their original height to the ground, rounded down (e.g. no damage for up to 9' of height difference). Landing on a soft enough material, using special items or class features, may prevent some of this damage.
In addition, when falling the creature must make an Acrobatics (Dexterity) save with the DC equal to half the falling height in ft., or fall [[Brawling Conditions#Prone|prone]].

## Death
 
When a creature's hit points drop to 0 or below it, it becomes prone and unconscious. At the start of each of its turns, its health becomes 0 (if it has below 0), and it makes a death flat check, with DC 10.

- On a critical success (natural 20 by default), it gains 2 death successes.
- On a success, it gains 1 death success.
- On a failure, it gains 1 death failure.
- On a critical failure (natural 1 by default), it gains 2 death failures.

More ways to accumulate death failures are:

- Dropping to 0 hit points or below from a critical hit makes the creature start with 1 death failure.
- Taking damage or losing hit points while dying gives 1 death failure.
- Taking damage or losing hit points from a critical attack while dying gives 2 death failures.
 
When a character gains 3 death successes, it stops rolling death checks and is stabilized but unconscious for the next 1d4 hours and its death successes and failures are cleared (go back to 0), in the end of which it wakes up with 1 hit point. Damage taken during stabilization ends it, and the creature goes back to rolling death checks each turn.  
When a character gains 3 death failures, it dies. Fate has gotten to it, and it can't be saved anymore.
 
Dropping to a negative amount of hit points equal to or greater than the creature's maximum hit points kills the creature immediately. In contrast, if the character's hit points are restored (via alchemical items or magical effects, etc.) and are raised above 0, the creature returns to consciousness and its death successes and failures are cleared.
