When a creature attacks with a ranged attack, sometimes the path from the origin to the target is not perfectly clear, and there may be many obstacles in the way, such as: walls, blockades, vehicles and even 
other creatures. For this reason, even a well-executed attack might miss its original target.

The levels of cover are as following:
1. +2 to AC of the covered creature, and -2 to Perception (Wisdom) checks against them. ^687bf7
2. +4 to AC of the covered creature, and -4 to Perception (Wisdom) checks against them.
3. Similar to [[Conditions#Hidden|hidden]], except that the duration is as long as the creature is covered.
