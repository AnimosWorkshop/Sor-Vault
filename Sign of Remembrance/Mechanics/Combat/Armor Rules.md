The world is made up of many different cultures, each with its own smithing and technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Shields are also considered a type of armor.
 
While not wearing any armor, your AC is equal to your base AC (default 9) + your Dexterity modifier + half your proficiency modifier (rounded up).  
Features which change your armor class calculation add another option to calculate it unless stated otherwise, but do not increase your AC when not calculating it using that option.
 
While you are incapacitated, your Dexterity modifier and any bonuses you have to your AC from holding weapons or shields do not increase your AC.

## Armor Types
 
Using armor effectively requires proficiency with the corresponding types. Each armor type is considered to have a training level, and progression must be rising, meaning that medium armor and shields require light armor training, and heavy armor requires (only) medium armor training.  
For each 1 level of training you are missing before armor of the type you are using, you will receive a -5' penalty to your movement speed, and a -1 penalty to checks based on Dexterity.  
For example:

- Using a shield without any armor proficiencies gives a -10' penalty to movement speed and -2 penalty to checks based on Dexterity.
- Using heavy armor while having light armor and shields proficiency gives a -10' penalty to movement speed and -2 penalty to checks based on Dexterity, as shields are in a separate branch from heavy armor.
- Using both heavy armor and a shield without any armor proficiencies gives a -25' penalty to movement speed and -5 penalty to checks based on Dexterity.
 
### Light Armor
 
Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier + half your proficiency modifier (rounded up) to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.
 
### Medium Armor
 
Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add half your Dexterity modifier + half your proficiency modifier (rounded up) to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.  
The shields branch is considered separate from the medium and heavy armor branch, and therefore using medium armor when you aren't proficient with them but proficient with light armor, even if you are proficient with shields, will still penalize you as if you were missing 1 level of armor training.
 
### Heavy Armor
 
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. You add half your proficiency modifier (rounded up) to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.  
The shields branch is considered separate from the medium and heavy armor branch, and therefore using heavy armor when you aren't proficient with them but proficient with light armor, even if you are proficient with shields, will still penalize you as if you were missing 2 levels of armor training, or 1 level if you are proficient with medium armor.
 
### Shields
 
A shield is made from wood or metal and is usually carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by the noted amount. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.  
The shields branch is considered separate from the medium and heavy armor branch, and therefore using shields when you aren't proficient with them but proficient with light armor, even if you are proficient with heavier armor types, will still penalize you as if you were missing 1 level of armor training.

## Armor Breakage and Weaknesses
 
Each type of armor has its own weaknesses, and an adventurer willing to break their opponent's armor must know that by heart. The armor table below also shows which kinds or armor are weak to which damage type. When armor gets struck by a critical hit using the damage type it is weak to, it gains 1 breakage level. Each breakage level causes its wearer a -1 penalty to their AC until it is repaired. Armor can have up to 3 breakage levels, as noted by the following list.  
Repairing a weapon requires an artisan with tools according to the type of weapon, and the price depends on the breakage level:
- Breakage 0 - None. The armor is perfectly fine.
- Breakage 1 - 10% of the original price of the armor. The armor shows a minor decrease in performance.
- Breakage 2 - 20% of the original price of the armor. The armor shows a major decrease in performance.
- Breakage 3 - The armor cannot be repaired. The armor is broken, and cannot be used effectively, meaning that your proficiency with it does not apply. The armor also does not have any of the properties and traits it normally does, including upgrades.
