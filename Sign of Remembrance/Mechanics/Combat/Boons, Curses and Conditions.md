## Boons and Curses
 
Magic in the world of Sor comes with boons and curses - lasting effects, which can be either good or bad. A blessing from a priest might give a peasant newfound hope or sudden courage to perform a heroic deed, while curses from evil conspirators might leave the victim lacking and lost.
 
Both boons and curses come from a magical source, be it a spell or lingering corruption, side effects, broken magical items and so on. For this reason, each boon and curse have the following attributes:

- **Type -** the specific type of the boon/curse
- **Source -** what gave the creature in question the boon/curse
- **Magic Level**
- **Magic Type**
- **Duration -** although "indefinite" is also an option

For example, let's say Edward was targeted by Ardon's spell [[Admittance]], cast at 1st-level. The boon's attributes are:

- **Type -** the Admittance spell
- **Source -** Ardon
- **Magic Level** **-** 1st-level
- **Magic Type -** Arcana 
- **Duration -** 1 minute, or until Ardon loses concentration.
 
Boons and curses of the same type cannot stack with each other, meaning that Ardon cannot use Admittance on Edward twice to gain twice the benefit, and even if both Ardon and Rina cast it on Edward, he would not gain twice the boon's effect.

## Conditions
 
A myriad of conditions can be found in the Inflicted Effects section, and so they will not be expanded upon here. The important thing to mention in a general sense about them, though, is condition vulnerabilities, resistances and immunities.
 
- Vulnerability - saving throws against the source that would cause the effect are made with disadvantage.
- Resistance - saving throws against the source that would cause the effect are made with advantage.
- Immunity - saving throws against the source that would cause the effect are automatically successful.
