## Travel

Travel is an important activity for adventurers, since most adventures do not occur within a 1 mile radius.
Travel time is dictated by movement speed, and notably as a group, by its slowest member. Each 10' of movement speed translate to 1 mile per hour of travel, before difficult terrain is taken into account. Walking through terrain such as mountains, uncharted trails in forests etc., can slow travel by 25% and even up to 50% in harsh conditions.

Every 2 hours of travel, creatures walking on foot must take 1 hour of rest. This does not have to be a "short rest", as light activity can still be performed, but it mustn't be travel. If they don't, then at the start of every 2 hours they must make a Constitution save with the DC being 12 + the amount of hours traveled since the last rest. On a fail, their [[Conditions#Fatigued|fatigue]] magnitude is increased by 1 until the next long rest is taken.

In total, a creature can be traveling for 12 hours a day, after which they suffer a level of [[Conditions#Fatigued|fatigue]] which takes 2 long rests to get rid of.

## Rest

A creature should have all of their basic needs taken care of during the day or night, lest they are prone to function much less effectively and feel lasting effects. Unless the following conditions are met daily, a creature's [[Conditions#Fatigued|fatigued]] magnitude is increased by 1 until they are met:
* They have not [[Provisioner#Cheap Equipment and Services|eaten]] at least 2 rations during that day or 3 rations if they traveled at least 16 miles by foot that day.
* They have not drunk water or equivalent drinks that day.
* They have not taken a [[#Long Rest|long rest]] that day.

### Short Rest
 
A period of rest or downtime at least 1 hour long, during which a character does not perform physically demanding tasks. Actions short rest may include eating, meditating or tending to wounds. This allows the character to recover some racial features and class features, as noted in the feature's description. Performing other actions might, depending on the specifics, prevent the character from enjoying the benefits of a short rest.
 
A character may spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to their maximum number of hit dice, as specified in their classes' pages. Once the dice are chosen, the player rolls these dice and recovers an amount of hit points equal to the sum of the rolls.
In addition, in the end of a short rest, a character gains an amount of hit points equal to half the sum of their Constitution modifier + their Willpower modifier.

A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.
### Long Rest
 
A period of rest or downtime at least 8 hours long, during which a character usually sleeps. During the rest, they may spend at most 2 hours doing light activity, such as eating, talking or keeping watch on camp. Any stressful or physically demanding activities taking over half an hour during a rest would interrupt it completely, forcing the character to start from the beginning.
A character not performing a long rest after 24 hours of being awake becomes [[Conditions#Fatigued|fatigued 1]] until they do.

It is important to mention that a long rest is technically made up of multiple short rests, which results in the characters attempting it regaining an amount of hit points and abilities depending on the time passed, even if the long rest as a whole was interrupted. 

>[!example]
>A long rest interrupted 4 hours from its start means that each character regains all of its short rest resetting abilities back, and an amount of hit points equal to 4 times (Constitution modifier + Willpower modifier).
 
At the end of a long rest, a character recovers their hit points up to their maximum, and some of their spent hit dice (according to the player's choice) up to a number of dice equal to half of the characterâ€™s total number of them ( with a minimum of one die).
 
A character cannot benefit from a long rest more than once a day, and they must start the rest with a positive amount of hit points (i.e. be able to be conscious) in order to gain it.
