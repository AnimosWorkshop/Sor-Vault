Many types of vision exist across the worlds. In order to understand it, we must first acknowledge how the concepts of light, and darkness, work. Contrary to what we have in the real world, light and darkness are both energy - darkness is not simply lack of light. These two types of energy cancel each other, which can results in three states:

- Lightness - a state in which there is light energy.
- Darkness - a state in which there is dark energy.
- Nullness - a state in which light and dark energies balanced each other out.

Magic can cause light or dark energy to appear. Magical light and dark cancel each other just as non-magical light and dark do, but they overpower their non-magical counterpart. In time, as the magical effects end, the magical light and dark turn into non-magical light and dark.  

><u>Note:</u> Flames can be either hotflames (emitting light) or coldflames (emitting dark), and there are torches corresponding to both.

## Vision Types

### Sight-Based Vision

The following table lists the different vision types and the level of cover creatures and objects have against creatures with such vision types. If a creature has mistvision, then the cover penalties for mistvision in mist and fog overrule the cover penalties for the other vision types they have.

| Vision Type | Lightness         | Nullness          | Darkness          | Mist, Smoke, etc. | Fog |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --- |
| Lightvision | 0                 | 1 (+ dull colors) | 2 (+ no color)    | 1                 | 2   |
| Nullvision  | 1 (+ dull colors) | 0                 | 1 (+ dull colors) | 1                 | 2   |
| Darkvision  | 2 (+ no color)    | 1 (+ dull colors) | 0                 | 1                 | 2   |
| Mistvision  | -                 | -                 | -                 | 0                 | 1   |

### Tremorsense
 
Very rarely, creatures possess the ability to sense through the ground, as they feel the trembles of the ground and are able to trace their source. This vision is affected like so by different ground conditions:

- Solid ground - no hindrances to Perception (Wisdom) checks within 30', after which the creature is effectively blind.
- Grain ground, muddy ground, etc. - Perception (Wisdom) checks are made with disadvantage up to 30' away, after which the creature is effectively blind.
- Liquids, gasses, etc. - Perception (Wisdom) checks automatically fail, and the creature is effectively blind.
