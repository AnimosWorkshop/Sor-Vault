## Proficiency Cap
 
The number of things a creature can learn in their life is a finite number. When a creature reaches their proficiency cap, they can't learn new proficiencies unless they forfeit a previous one when they are supposed to learn the new one. The proficiency cap is calculated according to the following formula, and it is filled as noted in the following table. Any features gained from a creature's race or class do not count towards their proficiency cap.
 
_Proficiency Cap_ = 15 + _Intelligence Score_
 
| **Proficiency Type**         | **Proficiency Points = # towards Cap** |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Any skill's proficiency rank | 1                                      |
| Any tool's proficiency rank  | 1                                      |
| Any weapon style's degree    | 1                                      |
| Armor (any one type)         | 2                                      |
| Language                     | 1                                      |
| Saving throw*                | 2                                      |
>[!note]
>As mentioned in the table, weapon proficiency is learned for an entire weapon style, as listed in the [[Weaponsmith|weapons table]].
### Training
 
Proficiencies can be trained on any character in a free-form manner, meaning that if they use their time correctly to learn a skill, they'll become proficient with it over time. The time it takes to train in a proficiency is about 8 weeks for each Proficiency Point (abbreviated as PP).  
Training is usually done over a period of downtime, in which the adventurers rest and prepare for the next adventure or journey. It can also be done actively - for example, in a mission where the adventurers build a boat or a ship, they might get 1 skill proficiency rank (for 1 PP) in the Athletics skill.
 
>[!note]
 Saving throws outside of race and class features can only be trained if you have one of the attributes contributing to that saving throw as at least 15. If a class feature would give you a saving throw proficiency with an attribute you are already proficient with, replace your downtime-trained one for another attribute you have at least 15 of, or replace the proficiency point entirely if you have no available attributes.
 
You may retrain features gained from training, investing as much time as it would take to normally train in them. As you do so, forfeit as many features you want equivalent to the feature you want to get, as long as those features are not gained as race or class features.
 
### Downtime Points
 
You may also trade proficiency points gained while adventuring for Downtime Points (abbreviated as DP). Those points are used in order to learn [[Runecarver#Spell Scrolls|spells]] and [[Sign of Remembrance/Martial Techniques/Introduction|martial techniques]], [[Crafting|craft items]] and [[#Earn Income|earn income]].
Each DP is worth about 2 weeks of training, which means that $1 PP = 4 DP$.

#### Earn Income
You may also invest DPs in order to work and earn income. Choose a skill, preferably your most trained one. Over a DP, you earn income equal to:
_Income = Proficiency Bonus * Chosen Skill Bonus_ (according to GM discretion, and whether it would make sense to earn income with that skill).
You may also use this in order to [[Crafting|craft items]] if you have a tool proficiency. 
Whenever you'd like to craft an item, as long as you possess the right tool proficiency to do so, pay the cost of the item and subtract the following amount from the cost (in silver coins) for each DP used, as long as at least 1 DP was used: 
_Savings = Proficiency Bonus * Crafting Bonus_
The crafting bonus may be either Intelligence or the [[Crafting|specific]] attribute mentioned for the tool.
