Items can be categorized into a few groups:
* Craftable items - divided between the 5 [[crafting]] professions, these can be made and sold by professionals.
* Materials - raw materials which can be found or extracted from the world, but also be traded as commodities, such as coins.
* Special items - usually magical items, these are either expensive materials with long descriptions, or one-of-a-kind items made by a god or otherwise.

Any creature may carry items, but carrying too much can make a creature [[Conditions#Encumbered|encumbered]]. Items' weight category (for the purpose of [[Action Economy#^359f07|minor]] / [[Action Economy#^30b3a9|major interactions]]) are separated from their _bulk_, which is a measure of an item's ease of carrying, as listed in its description. Items with negligible bulk are usually marked by (-) in the bulk column, and 10 negligible items make up 0.1 bulk, though most players wouldn't have to take note of that.
A creature can carry in any way items with bulk up to the creature's Strength score before becoming [[Conditions#Encumbered]|encumbered]].
