You gain all traits, features and ability score bonuses listed under your race and subrace.  \nAccording to the game setting, a game master might choose to limit which races can be played. For example, a good rule of thumb is to not allow dragon player characters, due to the race having obviously better features than other races, with the exception of not being able to level up until hitting the next age category, which becomes problematic when considering the flow of a campaign.","x":-70,"y":-340,"width":790,"height":300,"color":"1"},

Each result will be called a \"value\", and 7 values will be called a \"set\".  \nIn order to generate a value, roll the following: 6 + 1d4 + 1d6. By this system, the minimum generated value can be 8, and the maximum can be 16, although most values fall between 12 and 14.  \nIn order to generate a set, roll 9 values and remove two of them of your choice to generate your set. Those can be the lowest values, and you will not be blamed for doing so, but note that some characters shine through their weaknesses. Then, reorder the values as you wish.\n \n*An optional rule for more merciful game masters is to not count a stat rolling if all 9 values were below 13, which allows for more \"heroic heroes\". Alternatively, they can simply buff some of the rolls, etc.","x":-1700,"y":-630,"width":635,"height":420},

For example, leveling up to 1st level allows you to choose any of the \"base\" classes, while \"prestige\" classes an amount of levels to already be invested in other classes, like the partisan class which can only be taken after 3 other levels have been invested in any other class. Other prerequisites might be, for example, an ability score requirement or training in a specific skill.\n \nClasses grant features, according to the class page, including:\n* an initial set of proficiencies such as weapons, armor and skills\n* a maximum hit points increase and a [[Rest and Hit Dice|hit die]] per class level","x":-603,"y":840,"width":919,"height":580,"color":"4"},
