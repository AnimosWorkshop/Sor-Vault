## Upgrade Types
 
Each piece of equipment may be enchanted with one of each of the upgrade types. These types include: potency, functionality and property upgrades.

- **Potency** upgrades (mostly in the form of runes) increase the raw power of the equipment by the specified modifier (for example, +1). Potency runes can be upgraded from one to the next by paying the price difference.
- **Functionality** upgrades (mostly in the form of physical alteration of the item) change how the equipment behaves or reacts based on its natural function. Adding an additional functionality upgrade onto an item requires 3 gc for each additional upgrade already on the item, and most upgrades (such as masterwork weapons) can be applied multiple times this way. ^c655c3
- **Property** upgrades (mostly in the form of runes) are upgrades which don't change an item's raw potency or natural functional use. This upgrades may be added without a restriction.
 
In the items section, many upgrade recipes are written with a category of items in parentheses. The category refers to which items can be enhanced using these upgrades, for example:

- Arcana - any arcane spell focus
- Auramancy - any auramantic spell focus
- Histolecty - any histolectual spell focus

In addition, any item counts as a weapon for the purpose of weapon upgrades if used as such, and both armor and shields count as armor for armor upgrades.
 
The different upgrades available to get are listed in the crafting section, across the different pages, according to the tools required to get the upgrades.

## Attunement
 
Sometimes, invoking an upgrade of an item requires attunement, and is indicated by the _(Requires Attunement)_ notation next to the upgrade type.  
Each creature can attune to a number of items lesser than or equal to their proficiency modifier, and while an item can have multiple upgrades requiring attunement, attuning to the item includes all of its upgrades - counting as only 1 towards the attunement limit.
 
The process of attunement to an item can be initiated during a short or long rest. The item must stay close to the person wishing to attune to it for the whole rest, after which they are attuned. Only one creature may attune to an item unless specified otherwise, and when someone attunes to an already-attuned-to item, they override the item's attunement to themselves. From then on, they can be called the item's "attuned".
