#### Acrobatics
 
Acrobatics is a skill used when trying to maintain balance or general nimbleness. Examples include walking across a thin or rickety bridge, running along a slippery surface, or moving out of the way of a projectile.
 
#### Athletics
 
Athletics checks are used when determining feats of endurance, usually when difficulty is encountered while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include trying to scale a steep or slippery cliff, trying to make an unusually long jump, and resisting the pull of tides or monsters while swimming. It's also used when grappling a creature, and can be used to break free from a grapple.
 
#### Culture
 
Culture checks are used when trying to recall information about religion, books, poems or other texts that are known throughout culture.
 
#### Deception
 
Deception is used when lying. This can be verbally or not. If you're attempting to convince others of something untrue, Deception is called for. Using disguises, hiding the truth of situations, conning someone, and other situations of ambiguous truth all use Deception.
 
#### History
 
Much like the name suggests, History is used when recalling lore of the past. This can include wars big or small, legendary people, ancient kingdoms or lost civilizations, and miscellaneous historical events. It's also occasionally used when the name of an obscure land is brought up and determining if anyone knows of it.
 
#### Insight
 
Insight is a famous and frequently used skill. Primarily, it's used to determine if someone is being truthful or not. It can also be used to glean how suspicious someone may be, if they're hiding something even if not lying, and any other situation which calls for studying a creature's behaviors and what can be learned from it.
 
#### Intimidation
 
When trying to scare someone through threats, Intimidation is used. This can be through words alone, threatening to do something violent; or pulling out a dagger in a silent show. Intimidation can be applied to multiple situations, such as trying to get information out of a prisoner, convincing someone to reconsider their decisions, or showing off your lack of tolerance for nonsense.
 
#### Investigation
 
Not to be confused with Perception, Investigation determines what you're able to deduce about your surroundings or what you're studying. You might be able to figure out what weapon killed someone, locations of hidden doors or objects, weak points in structure, or the important bit of knowledge in a large book of text.
 
#### Medicine
 
Medicine checks are mostly used to stabilize dying creatures. It can also be used to diagnose illnesses and occasionally to determine how something died.
 
#### Nature
 
Nature checks are used when remembering lore and practice about nature. This includes terrain, plants and which might be safe to eat, animals and their behaviors, the weather, and natural cycles. It may also be used to identify different tracks found on the road, handling an animal and understanding its instincts and responses.
 
#### Perception
 
Perception is among the most well-known skills, and is frequently mistakenly used in place of investigation. It's used to determine how much a character notices of their surroundings. This can be intentional or not. It relies on basic senses rather than contemplative thought or deductions. Situations that might call for perception include standing guard, eavesdropping, and detecting hidden creatures or subtle sights.
 
#### Performance
 
Performance checks are used when entertaining audiences or putting up a charismatic speech regarding your actual appearance rather than your arguments. This can range from playing music to telling stories. It can, on occasion, also replace Deception or Intimidation if the act is dramatic enough. It determines how well a character can exaggerate to impress others.
 
#### Persuasion
 
Persuasion is used when trying to convince others your way. It is distinct from Deception and Intimidation because it's not through lies or threats, but convincing arguments, tact, social graces, and good nature. It's used when acting in good, honest faith. Situations that call for persuasion include convincing guards to let you speak to a noble, settling disputes between warring groups, or inspiring crowds into action.
 
#### Sleight of Hand
 
Commonly associated with thievery, Sleight of Hand is used in situations that requires careful hand work. While attempting to pickpocket someone does require it, other examples include hiding an object on your person or planting something on someone else. It may also be called upon when doing activities that require fine movements, such as: carving, drawing sketches, etc.
 
#### Stealth
 
Stealth checks are among the most common. They are used to determine how sneaky a character is being. Situations that use Stealth include slipping past guards, escaping situations unnoticed, hiding from enemies, or sneaking up on someone for a surprise. It may also be used to hide a message within normal speech, speak silently while hiding, etc.
 
#### Sorcery
 
Sorcery is used for recalling magical lore. This includes but is not limited to deciphering spells and understanding the magical properties of things around you.
