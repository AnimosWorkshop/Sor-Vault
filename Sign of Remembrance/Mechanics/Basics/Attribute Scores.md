## Scores and Modifiers
 
Each of a creature's attributes has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that attribute. An attribute score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.
 
A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.
 
Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). To determine an ability modifier, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).  
Because attribute modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, attribute modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.

### Attribute Increase
 
When you reach 2nd [[Progression and Levels|level]], and again at: 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th level, you can increase one attribute score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an attribute score above 20 using this feature.
