In the [proficiency](Proficiency and Downtime) page, we discussed how as creature levels rise, one's proficiency bonus grows with them. And yet, it's important to ask how level goes up at all, and what are the implications made by a character of a certain level?
 
It's almost bound to happen that in a game involving characters evolving and developing, we'd have some kind of leveling system. It may indicate many things, with the main one being the accumulation of experiences and knowledge, and the building of a character of any individual creature. Applying such a concept into a quantifiable game mechanic is difficult, yet is doable using a concept called the "tiers of gameplay."
 
Each tier is concerned with different kinds of tasks to level up, generating different experiences within the character which might serve as what allows them to grow as people and as adventurers, both in the unspoken aspect inside themselves, and the mechanical aspect as game characters. Conveniently enough, the tiers are sorted as how one's proficiency bonus goes up in levels.
 
When building both a world and a campaign, it is important to note the different tiers, and ask questions about the characters present: do they have enough training? Have they left their immediate nearby area to explore the world further? Do they have influence? Did they travel to other worlds? Most often, these questions will be able to guide a game master through the tiers and discern the right tier for the campaign, or to the non-player characters within it. Any character, either a PC and an NPC, may experience being "hard stuck" on the last level of their tier, only because they are unable to, or refuse to, experience things of the higher tier - even the best tour guide on a world might still be at 6th level because they never went and experienced the other worlds.

## Tiers List
 
#### Tier 1 - 0th Level
In this tier, characters are almost completely untrained for combat, which means that the danger the players can deal with is very low, and usually consists more of roleplay, mystery and intrigue than actual battles. This tier is usually fast, and serves as a great introduction to roleplaying and the general game system.
 
#### Tier 2 - 1st to 3rd Level
This tier is where most campaigns start in - it houses a great deal of more casual, localized threats, from thieves and bandits to minor villains, but not involving going out to the great world and exploring it. Both magic and martial prowess are low at this point, which only puts it slightly higher than our real world's dangers.
 
#### Tier 3 - 4th to 6th Level
This is the mid-tier gameplay, involving greater risks with national consequences. Usually the threats dealt with in this level range relates to the existence of an organization, vital missions for the good of a village, town or city - not alone, of course, but as a part of something bigger. Each of these levels grants exciting features to the characters: another martial technique, reliable spellcasting, 3rd-level spells or increased offensive and defensive abilities, saving throw proficiencies, and much more.
 
#### Tier 4 - 7th to 9th Level
Going into the higher tier of gameplay, this tier involves large-scale missions and projects with the purpose of making big changes in the world. Local challenges are no longer a big issue, with high survivability and high power, and what changes the most is the characters' legitimacy to act - their influence over others, with an ever-flowing aura of confidence. For this tier, interplanar travel is not only recommended, but mandatory, as progression in small scales cannot provide experience as much as it would in the earlier tiers.
 
#### Tier 5 - 10th Level
Being the highest tier of gameplay, a character at 10th level is at their peak performance, able to perform great tasks and make big changes even by oneself, although that too is usually done by influencing others. To truly come to this level of experience is difficult, requiring many difficult tasks to be overcome before, and getting recognition from others to one's actions. Few of the tier's members are usually alive at any point in time, as the world mostly has no place, or need, for people with such an amount of power - and their competition usually causes the demise of others. Great leaders of countries, armies and organizations, elder dragons and contenders to godhood tend to be most, if not all, of the members of this tier.
