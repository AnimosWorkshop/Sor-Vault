### Crafting Operation

Characters may use their tool proficiencies to craft items, provided they have basic knowledge about the item. While rare or complex items may require additional study to master their construction, most basic items can be crafted with a combination of general tool knowledge and some experimentation.

#### Crafting Supplies

Crafting requires supplies, which are generally available in towns and cities. These supplies are versatile and can be stored for future use. The efficiency of converting supplies into finished goods depends on whether the character is engaging in quick crafting or slow crafting:

- Quick Crafting - Supplies are converted to progress at a 1:1 ratio.
- Slow Crafting (via [[Proficiency and Downtime#Earn Income|Earn Income]]) - Supplies are converted to progress at a 1:2 ratio.

>[!example]
>A character with a potential 16 sc income use 16 silver coins (sc) worth of supplies can create items worth 16 sc in quick crafting or 32 sc in slow crafting, yielding their 16 sc profit margin.

Quick crafting can be performed by working over an entire day, in order to create items of their crafting profession. Make a crafting roll using your tool. The items created or progress made is can be up to a silver coins amount equal to your roll.

## Tools List
 
#### Alchemist
Alchemy is usually considered the spearhead of technology, using the mixing of materials and chemicals in order to create concoctions, poisons and more. Alchemist's tools include: a set of vials and alembics, a gas grill, a retort and a pestle and mortar.
 
#### Armorer
Armorers use skins, hides of creatures (although, mostly limited for beasts for sane folk) and metals of different kinds in order to make clothes, armor, saddles and covers for various items such as sword handles. The tools include: a skinning dagger, a jagged rock to clean skins, in addition to string and a sewing kit. They also need to have some workstations, such as a tanning rack or forge, in order to process these materials.

#### Provisioner
Provisioners know where to get the right things from the right people in order to properly craft or improvise any required item for adventurers on the road. The provisioner's tools include a sewing kit, bags or small sacks, strings, scissors and pins of different sizes
 
#### Runecarver
Runecarvers use specially crafted sigils called 'runes' in order to modify items with magical properties. It is a difficult art to master, involving extreme focus and knowledge, which results in a relatively small amount of people practicing it compared to other professions. The tools one would use include: a stabilizing apparatus, a special chisel, and the item itself.
 
#### Weaponsmith
Weaponsmiths forge weapons, be it out of wood, metal or any other material required. It requires physical fitness and finesse in order to correctly hit and mold the material, and create a functional object. As most of the necessary tools, such as an anvil and a forge, are to heavy to carry, most smiths travel with a hammer, a tough sander, a saw and a sharpening stone in order to operate on the road.
