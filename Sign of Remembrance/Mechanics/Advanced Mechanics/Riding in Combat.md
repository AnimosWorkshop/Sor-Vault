Creatures sometime make the choice to ride a bigger creature during combat. Usually this is done in order to increase their own speed, be able to control the creature on which they are riding, or move with them in order to protect and work together. Whatever the reason may be, this requires an adjustment to the rules in order to explain how the action economy works under those conditions.
 
### The Rider
 
- May take their movement as normal if not mounted.
- Mounting or dismounting cost half the rider's [[Action Economy#Movement|base movement speed]] to perform.
 
### The Ridee
 
- Their turn is taken with the rider, unless their turn already occurred in the same round (may happen if the rider is switched).
- Their movement is determined by the rider if they are willing, and by themselves if not.
- An untrained ridee will usually not use their action according to their rider's will, or even attempt to throw them off. This is requires an action which the ridee can choose to take, and functions similarly to the shove action. On a failed save, the rider takes appropriate fall damage and is prone.
- An intelligent creature might use their action as they wish. An unintelligent yet trained ridee may take their action according to their rider's will.
- Reactions may only be taken if the ridee wants to or is trained to do so.

>[!note] 
>The ridee has their own health point. If they drop to 0 hit points, the rider must make an Initiative save with DC 12 in order to not fall prone if the mount is not flying. If the ridee was flying, the rider has no saving throw, and they fall prone and take fall damage accordingly.
