The concept of unlife might seem foreign to those who have not had the chance to wield it - rightly so, without a fair amount of knowledge in sorcery. Every living creature in the world is made up of its three magical parts: the body, a physical manifestation held together in place with Arcana; the aura, taking care of biological processes with Auramancy; and the soul, a conscious mind able to link with others with Histolecty. Certain mental attributes might help one to control and learn from these: Intelligence being tied to arcana, Wisdom being tied to auramancy, and Charisma being tied to histolecty.
 
Yet, there is a fourth mental attribute: Willpower. A creature's willpower holds all of these components of life together, refusing to end before any of the components eventually gives up - traumatic damage caused to the body, eventual decay of old age, or madness. Yet, sometimes even one of these components failing isn't enough to end a creature. If a creature's willpower is strong enough, it might hold on for longer, being granted a gift only the most willing creatures can experience - a second chance. This second chance is called Unlife, and those who experience it - the Undead.

## Mechanics
 
When a creature dies, it must make a Willpower saving throw, with a DC of 20 + the creature's level, without adding any modifiers from spells or status effects. Upon a success, the creature might be able to unlive. They retain their original race, but their unlife begins tainted by an unfulfilled wish they had in life. Depending on their most dominant feeling, they gain a secondary race - their undead race.

- Hopelessness - Culamitus (more often than not being the collective result of mass disasters)
- Hubris - Advocate
- Revenge - [Banshee](Banshee.md)
- Restraint - [Hovler](Hovler.md)
 
Zombie races perform their undeath in 2d4 days from their death, and Ghost races perform their undeath in 1d4 days from their death. If a creature's body is mutilated dramatically during that period, the creature cannot undie. Careful burial, however, does not count as mutilation.
 
When a creature undies, the undead racial features are added to the creature's standard racial features. This comes with a few exceptions, which are also common for most, if not all, undead races:
- Size - the creature's original size remains.
- Creature Type - the creature becomes Undead in addition to its original creature type.
- Speed:
    - Zombies tend to have 5' less movement speed than the creature's original speeds.
    - Ghosts tend to preserve the creature's original speeds.
- Vision - the creature's original vision is replaced with nullvision and mistvision.
- Fortitude:
    - Zombie Fortitude - The creature loses 4 maximum hit points and their natural armor's base AC is lowered by 1, but they are resistant to Necrotic damage.
    - Ghost Fortitude - The creature loses 8 maximum hit points and their AC is lowered by 2, but they are resistant to: Slashing, Bludgeoning, Piercing damage, and are resistant 2 to Necrotic damage.
- Languages - all undead learn Peralian upon their undeath.
 
While zombies still need to eat, ghosts may feast on surrounding aura passively to maintain themselves. However, all undead still require sleep to not become tired. In addition, all undead continue to age and decay passively, according to their undead race.
