Base Requirement: 1st level, 10 Strength, 10 Wisdom, prolonged exposure to the Tree of Survival.

When prolonged exposure to the Tree of Survival is met with a receptive body, the influence seeps into the creature's systems. This soft imbuement prepares the soil for potential further influence, stressing the creature's basic instinct to survive.

Your Strength and Wisdom scores each increase by 1, and your Intelligence decreases by 1. When your health points are reduced below 50% for the first time after a long rest, you are thrown into a state of enhanced instincts and measured aggression:
* Your base movement speed increases by 5'.
* You get a +1 bonus to all saving throws.

This state lasts for 10 minutes or until danger has passed. After that, you become [[Conditions#Fatigued|fatigued 1]] until you perform a short or long [[Travel and Rest|rest]].
