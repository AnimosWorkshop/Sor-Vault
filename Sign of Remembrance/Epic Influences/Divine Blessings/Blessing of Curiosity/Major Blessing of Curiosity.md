Base Requirement: [Minor Blessing of Curiosity](Minor%20Blessing%20of%20Curiosity.md)
 
You have invented and gained knowledge so vast, that you will be remembered in history as the great maker, the inventor and torch of the world. This might include things such as: making a new magic school, making powerful artifacts, and so on. Just as the minor version of this blessing, it is inherited by your firstborn, who passes it down the bloodline to their own firstborn, and so on. Your Intelligence score increases by 4. In addition, your mastery over the [Aegis](Aegis.md) spell improves, allowing you to cast it once per day at 4th-level without expending any resources instead of at 2nd level.
