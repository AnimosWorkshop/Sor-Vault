You have proven your skill in research that would benefit the multiverse in years to come, earning you and your direct bloodline a newfound increase in learning rate. This blessing is inherited by your firstborn, who passes it down the bloodline to their own firstborn, and so on. Your Intelligence score increases by 2. In addition, you learn the [[Aegis]] spell, and may cast it once per day at 2nd-level without expending any resources.
