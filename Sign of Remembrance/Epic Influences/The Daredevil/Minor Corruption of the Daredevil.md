Base Requirement: 4th-level character, 15 Dexterity, 15 Charisma, access to a daredevil artifact
 
Allowing the Daredevil in opens your eyes to opportunities you have always seen, yet never dared to achieve. You can feel impulse and passion beckon, as the urge to take on the world becomes almost trivial, and emotions you have previously been able to suppress surface. 

Your Dexterity and Charisma scores increase by 2, and your Wisdom score decreases by 2. In addition, your base movement speed increases by 10', yet attack rolls for [[Action Economy#Opportunity Attacks|opportunity attacks]] against you are made with a +2 bonus.
