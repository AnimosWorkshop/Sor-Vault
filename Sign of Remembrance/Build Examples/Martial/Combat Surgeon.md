#Build #Martial 
With a dart that could bring both weal and woe, this character helps their allies without sacrificing versatility and defense.

### Attribute Priorities

* _Dexterity_ is the main attribute of the build, for both offense with the dart's [[Weapon Rules#Finesse|finesse]] property and defense.
* Either _Intelligence_ or _Wisdom_ are important for the [[Skills#Medicine|medicine]] skill, and help shape the build toward one of two possible second classes.

### Early Choices

* The [[Trickster|trickster]] class is the main class of the build, granting both useful martial tactics and [[Trickster#Fast Hands|Fast Hands]].
* Picking the [[Alchemist|alchemist]] profession allows for some versatility in alchemical items.
* Two great martial tactics are [[Careful Injection]] via trickster and [[Adrenaline Spike]], with the latter able to be taken via either trickster or transmuter.

### Midgame Choices

Starting at 4th level, the build can diverge to three main paths:
* Getting [[trickster]] levels is the best way to increase the damage potential at this point, since 3 levels were already taken in the class.
* Taking [[transmuter]] (even possibly at 3rd level, delaying or giving up on [[Trickster#Fast Hands|Fast Hands]]) alleviates financial concerns due to [[Transmuter#Makeshift Alchemy|makeshift alchemy]] and grants more day-by-day versatility, in addition to other utility features later on.
* Starting at 6th level, [[Nullifier|nullifier]] also starts becoming a possibility, as the class has great support features against magic.

### Key Items

* Using darts for both offense and supports makes them a great multitool, with the bonus that they're very cheap and do not break easily.
* [[Provisioner#Mid-Range Equipment|Apothercary's gloves]] are a rather cheap way to increase consistency.
* For roleplay purposes, [[Armorer#Upgrades|sterling armor]] is both a good defensive option and cleans itself from the bloody battlefield.
