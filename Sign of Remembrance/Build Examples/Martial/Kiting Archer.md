Using a ranged weapon and being able to move freely across the battlefield, this fighter is not afraid to move across the battlefield and even dance close to its melee enemies, trapping them on their way out.

### Attribute Priorities

* Either _Strength_ or _Dexterity_ are great options as main offensives stats, and each can be used with a corresponding weapon: longbows with Strength and crossbows with Dexterity.
* _Wisdom_ is important to improve the consistency of [[Trap Shot]]

### Early Choices

* A race with at least 30' walking speed will be able to better outrun melee enemies.
* The main class for this build is the [[fighter]].
* The first and main [[Fighter#Dirty Tactics|dirty tactic]] chosen will be Careful Step. Other tactics may be chosen at a later point, but this one captures the essence of the build best.
* At 2nd level, [[Trap Shot]] as a technique allows for a good turn sequence when starting near a melee enemy:
	* [[Action Economy#^665abd|Disengage]] as a quick action
	* Attack with Trap Shot
	* Move at least 20' away from the enemy
	For enemies with 30' movement speed, this implies that over a turn you will get at least 5' further than them, which opens the distance and prevents them from catching up to you.
* At 3rd level, the [[Fighter#Arms Specialty|Sharpshooter]] specialization improves the consistency of Trap Shot, as you will hit your attacks more often.

### Midgame Choices

At 4th level onward, the build can diverge onto multiple paths:
* Both continuing with the fighter class and diverging into [[Partisan|partisan]] gives an option to fire two shots each attack action, either with [[Fighter#Extra Attack|Extra Attack]] or [[Dual Shot]].
* [[Transmuter]]'s 2nd level gives a moderate damage boost using venoms and the [[Transmuter#^f1731b|rapid alchemical enhancement]] infusion, further enhanced by [[Lethal Shattering]].

### Key Items

* As both longbows and crossbows are two-handed only while shooting, having a free hand allows using both [[Alchemist#Concoctions|concoctions]] and [[Alchemist#Harmful Substances|venoms]].
* Upgrading ammunition with either [[Weaponsmith#Upgrades|flourish or masterwork]] is relatively cheap, however it is more of a consumable than for melee weapons. Keeping a few at hand is available even at lower levels, and can offer a difference in tough fights.
