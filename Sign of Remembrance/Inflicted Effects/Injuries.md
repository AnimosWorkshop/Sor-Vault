### Blinded 

A blinded creature can't see, failing on Perception checks which rely on sight, as well as having disadvantage on attacks and on Initiative saving throws. Attacks against a blinded creature are made with advantage.
### Broken Bones

You have suffered a traumatic injury from bludgeoning damage, causing your body to bear difficulty even a long time after the initial event.  
In the first stages of recovery, the creature should probably avoid any non-light activity, due to the large amount of stress on their body and the need to heal. Depending on their injury, one or more may apply:

- Hands - may only pick up light objects in up to two hands, or medium objects with two hands
- Legs - lose 20' of their base movement speed
- Torso - natural armor weakness to bludgeoning damage, double vulnerability to bludgeoning damage

After some time, just under a month, the pain eases and more activities may be performed. One or more of the following may apply:

- Hands - may not pick up heavy objects
- Legs - lose 10' of their base movement speed
- Torso - natural armor weakness to bludgeoning damage, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage

After a few more months later, the lingering effects of the injury keep getting weaker. One or more of the following may apply, and will last a few months until the creature recovers fully:

- Hands - heavy weapon attack rolls are made with a -1 penalty
- Legs - lose 5' of their base movement speed
- Torso - natural armor weakness to bludgeoning damage

Times of recovery may vary due to the severity of the event in which the injury had occurred.
### Burned Eyes

An injury happening due to a traumatic explosion placed near the face and eyes while not being protected. The initial pain is devastating, and the healing and rehabilitation process long, but with the right treatment (which includes alchemical and magical healing) a victim can return into action, even if with a light disability.  
In the first stages of recovery, the victim feels horrible headaches, and is blind. After some treatment, the headaches will lighten, but sensory stimulations based on sight causes those headaches to return.  
After a few months, vision will become clearer in small see well in nullness, and in light or dark environments (depending on the vision type) with a -2 penalty to perception rolls, until the condition fully heals at last. It is important to note that until that final stage, the recovery must still happen in a controlled environment and be assessed by medics, as making the process too quickly might cause further trauma which can then be irrecoverable.
### Debilitating Gash

You have suffered a traumatic injury from slashing damage, resulting in a long gash across your torso or one of your limbs.  
In the first few days to a week after the injury had occurred, the victim suffers a -2 penalty to all Dexterity-based checks and rolls, and a -2 penalty to their Dexterity modifier when calculating their AC (meaning that if they wear heavy armor, for example, their AC is not reduced).  
After that initial period, the penalty is reduced to -1 for just over a month, eventually leaving only scars behind to mark the trauma.
### Lame

A simple leg injury, usually only lasting a few hours to a few days. Causes the injured creature's movement speed to be dropped 5' lower than usual. Severe cases might drop the movement speed lower, especially if both legs are affected.
