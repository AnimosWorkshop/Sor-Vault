#### Nerodil Poisoning
This case of food or water poisoning causes the creature to feel a certain degree of delay between what they want to do and the time when they actually move or act. For as long as they continue to consume the infected food or water, they are under effects akin to the [[Brawling Conditions#Restrained|restrained]] condition. The disease passes naturally 2 days after halting the consumption of the cause.
