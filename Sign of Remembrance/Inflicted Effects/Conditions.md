#### Decaying
Negative energy flows through your veins, disrupting your healing processes. Any form of healing you receive recovers only half the hit points it should have, rounded down.  
>[!example]
>You receive half the healing from potions, spells, etc., and also recover only half the difference between your maximum and current hit points during a long rest.
#### Encumbered
An encumbered creature has a -2 penalty to all rolls based on Strength and Dexterity, including Resilience and Initiative saving throws, as well as to their AC. In addition, their movement speed is 10' slower.  

A creature is usually encumbered while the weight of creatures or items they wear and carry exceeds a number of lb equal to 6 times their Strength score. If the creature's carried weight exceeds 10 times their Strength score, double the condition's effects.
#### Grappled
While grappled, a creature's movement speed is zero, and the grappler can move at half speed in order to force the grappled creature to move with them. An effect which forces the grappled creature away from the grappler ends this condition.  
While grappled, the creature may use an action to attempt a saving throw (usually a Resilience save unless stated otherwise) to end this condition, using the original DC for the grapple.
#### Hidden
You are hidden from some or all the creatures around you, depending on how you got this condition. You have advantage on attack rolls and Athletics, Deception, Sleight of Hand and Stealth checks against creatures you are hidden from.  
Once you are revealed, such as by performing an action which would expose your location, you cease to be hidden from all creatures who could notice you. For example, if you attack a creature while hidden, you cease to be hidden after the attack is performed.
#### Incapacitated
An incapacitated creature can't use their movement or any actions, quick actions or reactions, except for attempting to end this condition if able (varies case by case, for example - a creature with their hands tied in a rope can't simply break free, but they might be able to use a knife in their back pocket to cut it). In addition, they have disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity based rolls, including Resilience and Initiative saves, and have -4 to their AC.
#### Invisible
An invisible creature is unable to be perceived using sight, although it can still be traced using touch, smell or sound. An invisible creature has advantage on attacks, and attacks against them are made with disadvantage.
#### Pacified
The creature is pacified, reducing its combat capabilities. Their attacks and damage rolls and saving throws are made with a -1 penalty, and their AC is reduced by 1.  
This condition can be given with a certain potency, with the default being 1. The attack and damage roll penalty, the save penalty and AC reduction is equal to that potency.
#### Prone
The creature is lying on the floor. Melee attacks the creature makes are made with disadvantage, melee attacks against it are made with advantage, and ranged attacks against it from at least 10' away are made with disadvantage. It also has disadvantage on Initiative saving throws. 

The condition can normally be ended by expending walking speed equal to half their race's base speed, or by expending any amount of flying speed.

If a creature attempts to get up on a difficult terrain, they must succeed on an Acrobatics (Dexterity) check with DC 10.
#### Restrained
A restrained creature has a -2 penalty to all rolls based on Strength and Dexterity, including Resilience and Initiative saving throws, as well as to their AC.
#### Stunned
A stunned creature is unable to move and use any actions, quick actions and reactions. Attacks against the creature are made with advantage, they have disadvantage on Initiative saving throws, and they don't add ability modifiers to their AC calculation.
#### Fatigued
Being fatigued has three degrees, with rising severity:
1. Movement speed decreased by 5', -1 to saving throws.
2. Movement speed decreased by 10', -2 to saving throws, -1 to attack rolls, AC and skill checks.
3. Movement speed decreased by 15', -2 to all rolls which are not flat checks and AC.

Receiving this condition while already tired increases its magnitude by the applied amount. Then, having this condition alleviated by any of the effects ending decreases it by that magnitude.
#### Toppled
While toppled, a creature's movement speed is zero, and both the creature and the one who toppled them are prone in the same position. An effect which forces the toppling creature away from the toppled creature ends this condition.

While toppled, the creature may use an action to attempt a saving throw (usually a Resilience save unless stated otherwise) to end this condition, using the original DC for the topple.  
When this condition ends, the toppled creature becomes prone instead.
#### Unconscious
An unconscious creature is unable to move and use any actions, quick actions and reactions. Attacks against the creature have advantage, they are unaware of their surroundings, and they don't add attribute modifiers (such as Dexterity) to their AC calculation.
#### Weakened
The creature's body is weakened, giving them disadvantage on attack rolls and Strength-based checks, including Resilience saving throws. In addition, the DC against [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl actions]] the creature makes is decreased by 5.
