#### Decaying
Negative energy flows through your veins, disrupting your healing processes. Any form of healing you receive recovers only half the hit points it should have, rounded down.  
>[!example]
>You receive half the healing from concoctions, spells, etc., and also recover only half the difference between your maximum and current hit points during a long rest.
#### Encumbered
An encumbered creature has a -2 penalty to all rolls based on Strength and Dexterity, as well as to their AC, and their movement speed is 10' slower. In addition, Resilience and Initiative saves they make must rely on Constitution and Wisdom rather than on Strength and Dexterity, respectively.
#### Fatigued
Fatigue has three degrees, with rising severity:
1. Movement speed decreased by 5', -1 to saving throws.
2. Movement speed decreased by 10', -2 to saving throws, -1 to attack rolls, AC and skill checks.
3. Movement speed decreased by 15', -2 to all rolls which are not flat checks and AC.

Receiving this condition while already fatigued increases its magnitude by the applied amount. Then, having this condition alleviated by any of the effects ending decreases it by that magnitude.
#### Hidden
You are hidden from some or all the creatures around you, depending on how you got this condition. You have advantage on attack rolls and Athletics, Acrobatics, Deception, Sleight of Hand and Stealth checks against creatures you are hidden from.  
Once you are revealed, such as by performing an action which would expose your location, you cease to be hidden from all creatures who could notice you. For example, if you attack a creature while hidden, you cease to be hidden after the attack is performed.
#### Invisible
An invisible creature is unable to be perceived using sight, although it can still be traced using touch, smell or sound. An invisible creature has advantage on attacks, and attacks against them are made with disadvantage.
#### Pacified
The creature is pacified, reducing its combat capabilities. Their attacks and damage rolls and saving throws are made with a -1 penalty, and their AC is reduced by 1. 

This condition can be given with a certain potency, with the default being 1. The attack and damage roll penalty, the save penalty and AC reduction is equal to that potency.
#### Stunned
A stunned creature is unable to move and use any actions, quick actions and reactions. Attacks against the creature are made with advantage, they have disadvantage on Initiative saving throws, and they don't add ability modifiers to their AC calculation.
#### Unconscious
An unconscious creature is unable to move and use any actions, quick actions and reactions. Attacks against the creature have advantage, they are unaware of their surroundings, and they don't add attribute modifiers (such as Dexterity) to their AC calculation.
#### Weakened
The creature's body is weakened, giving them disadvantage on attack rolls and Strength-based checks, and Resilience saves they make must rely on Constitution rather than Strength. In addition, the DC against [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl actions]] the creature makes is decreased by 4.
