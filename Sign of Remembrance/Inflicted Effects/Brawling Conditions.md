#### Grappled
While grappled, a creature's movement speed is zero, and the movement is controlled by the _grappler_, which is the creature that causes them to be in this condition. The grappler may use their own [[Action Economy#Movement|movement speed]] to move either them or the grappled creature, making movement in tandem cost double the speed. In addition, the grappled creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against any creature other than their grappler.

While grappled, the creature may use an action to attempt a saving throw (usually a Resilience save unless stated otherwise) to end this condition, against either a basic Athletics (Strength) DC imposed by the grappler, or another DC if stated otherwise.
An effect which forces the grappled creature away from the grappler ends this condition.  
#### Prone
The creature is lying on the floor. Melee attacks the creature makes are made with disadvantage, melee attacks against it are made with advantage, and ranged attacks against it from at least 10' away are made with disadvantage. It also has disadvantage on Initiative saving throws. 

The condition can normally be ended by expending walking speed equal to half their race's base speed, or by expending any amount of flying speed. If a creature attempts to get up on a difficult terrain, they must succeed on an Acrobatics (Dexterity) check with DC 10.
#### Restrained
A restrained creature has a -2 penalty to all rolls based on Strength and Dexterity, including Resilience and Initiative saving throws, as well as to their AC.
#### Toppled
While toppled, a creature's movement speed is zero, and both the creature and the one who toppled them are prone in the same position. An effect which forces the toppling creature away from the toppled creature ends this condition.

While toppled, the creature may use an action to attempt a saving throw (usually a Resilience save unless stated otherwise) to end this condition, using the original DC for the topple.  
When this condition ends, the toppled creature becomes [[#Prone|prone]] instead.
