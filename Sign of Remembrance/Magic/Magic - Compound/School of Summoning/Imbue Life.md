- Material Components: [Soul stone](Runecarver.md) put inside a poppet vessel  

You use the primal force of magic to imbue life from an enchanted soul stone into the poppet. The poppet, small in size and consisting usually of organic material, absorbs the soul stone's energy to house the soul in it to become a construct.  
The elemental has the personality of the soul in the soul stone, getting its mental stats, memories and class levels. The base body, however, depends on the poppet provided. A few examples for poppet vessels:
 
### Clay Poppet

_Small Elemental_  
Str 12 / Dex 10 / Con 13  
**Base Health:** 12  
**Base AC:** 11 (bludgeoning weakness)  
**Vision:** Normal  
**Speed:** 25' walking
 
### Flesh Poppet

_Small Elemental_  
Str 10 / Dex 13 / Con 12  
**Base Health:** 12  
**Base AC:** 10 (slashing weakness)  
**Vision:** Normal  
**Speed:** 30' walking
 
### Plant Poppet

_Small Elemental_  
Str 13 / Dex 12 / Con 10  
**Base Health:** 12  
**Base AC:** 10 (slashing weakness)  
**Vision:** Normal  
**Speed:** 30' walking
 
The construct acts on their own, according to their personality. When the body is destroyed, the soul stone is taken outside of the poppet, or the spell's duration ends, the soul returns to the soul stone.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The spell's duration increases by 7 hours for each spell level above 1st. At 5th level, it becomes permanent, but also binds the soul's existence to the body's, meaning that it'll die when the body does and consuming the soul stone.
