#3rd-Level #Auramancy #Tempest #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: Until the end of your next turn*  

You infuse the target with static charge, which gets stronger as others try to get close to them. For the boon's duration, melee attacks and touch spells directed at the target cause the attacker or caster to take 1d8 lightning damage, unless the attacker or caster also are under the Static Ward boon. In addition, the booned creature has a +1 bonus to Resilience and Initiative saves.  
You may maintain this ward from up to 90' from the target for 1 additional round if you use your bonus action, up to 1 minute.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The attacker or caster take 1d8 additional lightning damage for each spell level above 3rd.
