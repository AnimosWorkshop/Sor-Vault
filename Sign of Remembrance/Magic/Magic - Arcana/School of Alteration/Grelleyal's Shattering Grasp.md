You apply immense pressure on an object, such as weapon or armor, in an attempt to break it. Make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the attack deals 2d8 force damage with the Lethal 4 property, and on a critical hit, the object gets 1 breakage level.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The attack deals 1d8 additional force damage for each spell level above 2nd, and the object's breakage level increases by an additional 1 for each 2 spell levels above 2nd.
