#2nd-Level #Arcana #Tempest #Curse
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60' (5' line)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute  

You send an electrifying wave in a direction of your choosing. Each creature in range must succeed on an Resilience saving throw or become cursed for the duration.  
Cursed creatures are [weakened](Conditions.md), but their movement speed is doubled. When they take lightning damage, they receive 1d10 additional lightning damage, are stunned until the end of their next turn and the spell ends on them.  
If you cast a concentration spell with casting time of action + quick action or less while concentrating on Hypercharge, then Hypercharge ends only after the other spell is cast.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The creatures receive 1d10 additional lightning damage if dealt lightning damage while charged for each spell level above 2nd.
