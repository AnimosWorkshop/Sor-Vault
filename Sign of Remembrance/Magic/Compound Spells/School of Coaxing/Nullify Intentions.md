- Casting Time: 1 reaction to a creature taking an action, quick action or attempting to move within range
- Range: Touch
- Duration: Instantaneous  

As a creature within your reach attempts to make a move, you perform deft and quick movements to prevent them from doing so. The creature must make a Willpower saving throw or stop what they were doing:

- If this spell was cast in response to an action or quick action, it stops. Spell resources are expended as normal.
- If this spell was cast in response to movement, the creature's movement becomes 0 until the end of their turn.
