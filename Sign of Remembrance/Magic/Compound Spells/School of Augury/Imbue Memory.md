You touch an object to imbue it with a vivid memory from your past, or the knowledge of a specific person or object. Creatures who touch that object can allow themselves to get an immediate understanding of whatever you imbued onto the token, either seeing a vision of the memory, or coming to know the person or object from that point onward, allowing the creature to seek them using augury magic, such as with the [Locate Object](Locate%20Object.md) and [Message](Message.md) spells.
