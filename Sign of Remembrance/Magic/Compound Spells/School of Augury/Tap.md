You tap into a creature's histolectual fountain, allowing you to sense attempts to communicate with or message them. If the creature is unwilling, they must succeed on a Wits saving throw, or be affected by this spell for the curse's duration. You may choose one of two modes as you cast this spell:

- Monitor – Whenever the creature is targeted by the Message or Dream spells, or is affected by telepathic communication, you also receive the messages conveyed.
- Intercept – Whenever the creature is targeted by the Message or Dream spells, or is affected by telepathic communication, you receive the messages conveyed instead of them. In the case of the Message spell or telepathic communication, you may also reply if you wish to, according to the original effect.

Creatures attempting to communicate with the creature using the means detailed above do not notice the effects of this spell.
