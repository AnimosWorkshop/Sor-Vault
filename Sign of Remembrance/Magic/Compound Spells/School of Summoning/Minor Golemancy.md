Over a long ritual, you manage to place a hyper-responsive arcane engine inside a physical vessel, allowing it to react and move on its own. When you create a golem, you may give it a simple command, which it will attempt to follow until it is unable to. The command may be changed by casting the spell again on the golem, without material components. Only the golem's creator may change its command, unless both the creator and the new master cast the spell as a coven spell together (without material components), which allows ownership to change as the creator wishes.  
The command may be more complex the if creator is experienced - in which case more exceptions, conditions and limitations may be added to the command.
 
The most common material for a golem created with this spell is clay, which can be easily enchanted using this spell and is rather malleable. An example for a golem with a medium clay vessel is:
