#1st-Level #Compound #Auramancy #Histolecty #Summoning 

* Casting Time: Channel
* Range: 30'
* Duration: 1 hour

You tear a small piece of your aura and bond, using up one of your heat dice, to create an elemental with which you may communicate telepathically. The elemental is small, but its form is flexible, allowing you to change its form using a quick action, not only to forms of living creatures but also to objects.

You may dismiss and re-summon the elemental using your quick action. If the elemental gets further than 45' of you, it is dismissed automatically.
