_"That which is not dead,_  
_May eternal lie;_  
_And at the end of ages,_  
_Even death may die."_  
_- Vorona, the Oracle. 1274 Second Verse._
 
You grant a creature you can see within range a swift resolution. The creature must make a Wits saving throw, taking 4d12 necrotic damage, or half on a successful save. If the creature is affected by the [[Conditions#Decaying|decaying]] condition, they automatically fail the saving throw.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The creature takes 1d12 additional necrotic damage for each spell level above 3rd.
