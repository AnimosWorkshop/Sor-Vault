#2nd-Level #Histolecty #Tempest #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You amplify your voice, causing it to sound loud and clear even for up to 90' away for the duration of the boon. At any time during the boon's duration, you may use a quick action to use all remaining energy and detonate it at once, forcing all other creatures in a 20' radius around you, even if they are not bound by you, to make a Resilience saving throw. Creatures take 2d10 thunder damage, or half on a success.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The boon lasts twice as long.
* (+1) When detonating, each creature takes 1d10 additional thunder damage.
