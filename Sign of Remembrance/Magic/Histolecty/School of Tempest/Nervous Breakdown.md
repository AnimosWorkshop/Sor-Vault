Uncommon
 
- Casting Time: Channel
- Range: 30'
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute  

A creature you can see within range is afflicted by extreme anguish, locking their body physically and mentally. After your first casting action, the creature takes a -2 penalty to their AC and all saving throws, in addition to having their movement speed halved. When you finish your channeling, the creature must make a Wits saving throw, becoming stunned for the curse's duration. 

While stunned, the creature takes 1d6 lightning damage and 1d6 psychic damage at the start of its turn, and may make a Wits saving throw in the end of its turn.  
If the creature succeeds on its Wits saving throw against this spell, the spell ends.
