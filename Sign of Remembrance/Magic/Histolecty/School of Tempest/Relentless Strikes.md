#3rd-Level #Histolecty #Tempest
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: Self
- Duration: Instantaneous  

Fast as the winds told of in the legends, you strike furiously, making three weapon attacks, all of them against [[Histolecty#^8e3f1d|histolectually bound]] creatures. The damage dealt is as normal, but your physical attribute is added as lightning damage. 
After finishing all your attacks, each creature who took lightning damage has the lightning imbued within them suddenly snap, taking 1d0 sensory damage. You also take damage equal to the total sensory damage dealt, as the storm snaps within you as well.

 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) You may make an additional attack.
