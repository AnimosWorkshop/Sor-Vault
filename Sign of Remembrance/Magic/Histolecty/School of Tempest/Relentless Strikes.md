#2nd-Level #Histolecty #Tempest
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: Self
- Duration: Instantaneous  

Fast as the winds told of in the legends, you strike furiously, making three weapon attacks, all of them against [[Histolecty#^8e3f1d|histolectually bound]] creatures. The attacks are made as if you used the [[Action Economy#^941070|Attack]] action, meaning that, for example, you could switch some for [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl]] actions, and your physical attribute modifier is added to the damage.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) You may make an additional attack.
