_As the people of the Blue Dragonland saw the awe-inspiring ball of crackling light moving through the night sky, all the residents down below knew that their beloved Elder guards them; even if they couldn't seem him through the brightness, the familiar histolectual aura was enough for them to feel his soul gently touch each and every one of them - charisma only few leaders throughout history ever managed to match._
 
You charge yourself with high levels of electricity, and release it in an instant burst. Until the end of turn, you gain 45' of additional movement speed in each movement type you have above 0. Then, you may move according to your movement speed, as long as at least 45' of it is used in any one "forward" direction, and you don't move at all in the direction opposite to it (you may turn), even moving through other creatures' spaces. Any creature you pass through must make an Initiative saving throw, taking 3d12 lightning damage or half on a successful save. On a failed save, the creature also has disadvantage on Willpower checks until the start of their next turn. You may not end this movement inside another creature or object, and creatures cannot make attacks of opportunity against you during this movement.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) Any creature you pass through takes 1d12 additional lightning damage.
