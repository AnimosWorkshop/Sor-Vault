You shout a command, which is readily felt within the minds of creatures who can hear you within 40'. You draw a mental line, up to 20' in length between two points you can see within range. The line can be seen by any creature who can hear the command, and its influence affects those creatures as long as they are within 1' of it.

A creature under the line's influence cannot move on their turn outside the line, unless they succeed on a Willpower saving throw. However, while under the influence, they have a +1 bonus to saving throws, and a damage reduction of 1 for all damage types if they successfully used a defensive reaction (including class features and spells) during the current round.

**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+2) The saving throw bonus and damage reduction are increased by 1.
