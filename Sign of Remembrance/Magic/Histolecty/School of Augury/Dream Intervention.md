#4th-Level #Histolecty #Augury #Boon
 
- Casting Time: 1 minute
- Range: The whole world
- Duration: 1 minute  

You use the unconscious of a creature within range you have memories of or have [[Imbue Memory|seen memories of]] to more easily slip into their minds. If they are unconscious, they may roll a Willpower save. On a fail or if they are willing, you become unconscious as well, and manage to see their dream yourself, and the dreaming creature sees you. For the boon's duration, you may communicate in any way you'd like during the dream, exiting the dream when the spell ends.  
If the creature is not unconscious when you cast this spell, they may decide to drop unconscious willingly for the boon's duration for the spell to work. If they refuse in this situation, the spell ends immediately.
