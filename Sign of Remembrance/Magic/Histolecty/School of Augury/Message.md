You say a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature you are familiar with. If the creature is within range, regardless if you are histolectually bound to them, they hear the message in their mind, and recognize you as the sender if they know you. The recipient may answer you in a like manner immediately.  
You do not gain awareness whether the creature received your message if they do not reply.
