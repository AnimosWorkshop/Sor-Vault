- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60'
- Duration: 1 minute

You cast your hand forward, and a patterned flash appears in front of you, inducing awe within your allies and fear within your enemies. Designate up to 2 creatures within range for Awe and up to 2 creatures for Fear.

- Each Awed creature is Booned for the duration, gaining a quick action which allows them to get a +2 for all rolls until the end of the current turn.
- Each Feared creature is Cursed for the duration. At the start of their turn, they must make a Willpower saving throw. On a fail, they must expend their quick action on getting over their fear, or they get a -2 penalty to all rolls for the rest of their turn. On a success, the curse ends.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) You may choose another creature to either bestow a boon or a curse.
