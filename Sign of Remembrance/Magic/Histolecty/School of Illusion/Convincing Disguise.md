#2nd-Level #Histolecty #Illusion #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Duration: 2 hours  

You make yourself and the possessions on your person look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thinner or fatter if you wish to. You canâ€™t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.  

Also while choosing the illusion, pick a skill from: Persuasion, Deception, Performance, Intimidation, Stealth. You have a +1 bonus to that skill against creatures the illusion affects.  

When a creature goes into either your original or your illusion's space, they make a Wits saving throw. On a success, they discern the illusion, but on a fail they find a logical conclusion for the mismatch and ignore it.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The spell lasts for twice as long.
