#4th-Level #Histolecty #Illusion #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 120'
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You designate up to 3 other creatures within range in addition to yourself. You declare one of the following options. Depending on what you choose, the designated creatures are able to sense visual and audible cues to get a bonus at, and for achieving that option for the boon's duration:

- Attack - each creature gets a +1 bonus to attack rolls. Whenever any of them makes an attack, all of the creatures get a +1 bonus to damage rolls until the end of your next turn. This bonus stacks.
- Defend - each creature gets a +1 bonus to AC. Whenever any of them uses a non-spell defensive reaction from a class feature (such as: [[Fighter#Parrying Strike|parrying strike]], [[Trickster#Cunning Action|dodge]], [[Paragon#Call of Protection|call of protection]] etc.), all of the creatures get a +1 bonus to damage reduction until the end of your next turn. This bonus stacks.
- Perform - each creature gets a +1 bonus to skill checks, and to skill-related DC's they set. Whenever any of them makes a skill check or sets a skill-related DC for another creature, all of the creatures get a +1 bonus to that skill's checks and related DC's they set until the end of your next turn. This bonus stacks.

The bonuses attained from performing the action occur before their trigger, so for example, for Attack, the damage roll would be increased even for the attack the creature just made, and not just the next ones.
