You try to implant inside a creature's head that either you or them are the center of the world, as if a spotlight shines directly on one of you. The target must make a Wits saving throw. On a failed save, they take 1d8 psychic damage and you choose one of the following:

- If the spotlight is on you, they has disadvantage on perceiving your allies other than you, as you wholeheartedly catch their attention.
- If the spotlight is on the other creature, they have disadvantage on perceiving their allies, focusing only the unknown and hostile around it and how to handle it.
