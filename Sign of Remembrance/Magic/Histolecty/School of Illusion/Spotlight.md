- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60'
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes  

You focus a creature's attention on another, as if a spotlight shines directly on them. The target must make a Wits saving throw. On a failed save, they take 2d6 psychic damage and for each target you choose one of its enemies. Whenever they move during the spell's duration, they must choose their spotlit target as the enemy they cannot take [[Action Economy#Opportunity Attacks|opportunity attacks]] from as long as they are able to see them, even if they are not within melee range.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) You may choose an additional target, but you must use the same mode on all creatures.
