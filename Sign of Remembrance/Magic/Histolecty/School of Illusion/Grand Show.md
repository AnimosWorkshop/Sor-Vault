#3rd-Level #Histolecty #Illusion #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 20' sphere around the caster
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour  

You put out an illusion around you containing anything you'd like, from objects, to fog, and even moving creatures. For the duration of the boon, the illusion moves with you in a way you choose - for example, illusory creatures might follow you around, etc. Any interactions with the illusion or a voluntary Search action may prompt a Wits saving throw, which breaks the illusion for the initiator on a success. Attacking the illusion or targeting it with a spell counts as interactions with the illusion for this purpose.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The radius of the sphere increases by 10' for each spell level above 3rd.
