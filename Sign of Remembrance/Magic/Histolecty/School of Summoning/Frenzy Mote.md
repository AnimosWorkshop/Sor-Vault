- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30'
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You summon a frenzy motes, which appears as a tiny storm cloud with feint rhythmic thuds sounding from it. It can be moved and attached to a creature in the same space as itself as a part of casting the spell or using a quick action, which causes it to follow that creature to the best of their ability. 
When the mote attaches to a creature, they choose one aspect of frenzy to enhance them:
* +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls
* 10' additional movement speed
This bonus lasts until the mote detaches from the creature.
 
The motes' stats are as follows. When it drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the mote vanishes.
