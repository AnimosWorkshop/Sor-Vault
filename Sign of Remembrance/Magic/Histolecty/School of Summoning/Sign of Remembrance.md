- Duration: 12 hours  

_All things, good and bad, come to an end. Long after they're gone, we make icons of them. We refuse to forget what they meant to those who lived back then, and refuse to deny what them mean to us now. We all stand on the shoulders of giants, carried by their will to live; by their sacrifices. We will remember even if no one else will, without the guiding light of divinity, and carry the coldflame to the last of days._

You manifest a small ring in the palm of your hand. Any creature holding it may put it on their finger as a quick action, and the ring magically adapts to their size. The ring glows with a faint dark aura, is cold to the touch, and may bear a symbol of your choice. The ring has 2 magical cords wrapped tightly opposite to the symbol, which contact the wearer's finger on one side and the outside world on the other.
 
A creature wearing the ring may use 2 reactions when they fail a saving throw, shattering 1 cord in a sudden burst of dark. The creature automatically succeeds the save, and gives up on the quick action on their next turn. Alternatively, they may use up the ring as an action to end a curse on themselves of 5th level or lower which lasts up to 1 day. However they choose to use it, they get 25 temporary hit points for the next hour after the ring shatters.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The ring can remove a curse of 1 level higher and grants 5 additional hit points when a cord is shattered.
