You summon two calming elemental motes, which appear as a tiny bright cloud, about the size of a palm. Each can be moved and attached to a creature in the same space as itself as a part of casting the spell or using a quick action, which causes it to follow that creature to the best of their ability.  Both motes can be controlled using the same quick action.  
While attached to a creature, they are under the [[Conditions#Pacified|pacified]] 1 condition. A mote can only be attached to a creature which has no other calming motes attached to them.
