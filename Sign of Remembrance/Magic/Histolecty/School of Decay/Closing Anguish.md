You spot a creature who noticeably struggles with its current state of health, and use it to close in on them mentally. Choose a creature you can see within range. You deal 1d4 + your histolecty modifier damage to them in total, half in psychic damage and half in necrotic damage. If they are below half of their maximum health, or are affected by a curse, double this damage. If they satisfy both conditions, triple it instead.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The damage is increased by 1d4.
