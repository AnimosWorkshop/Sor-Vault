#1st-Level #Histolecty #Alteration 

- Casting Time: Channel
- Range: 20'
- Duration: Instantaneous

You hold out a weapon or a histolectual spell focus, extending it as if it is a paintbrush to draw your influence with upon the world. 
* During the first channel action, designate a creature who can see or hear you within range. That creature recovers 1d4 hit points.
* During the second channel action, you use your held weapon or spell focus to exert your influence. Perform a melee spell attack against a creature, with an added reach of 5'. If the attack hits, the designated creature recovers 1d6 hit points, and for the attack's damage:
	* Weapon - use the weapon's damage die + 1d6 kinetic damage.
	* Spell focus - deal 2d6 kinetic damage.
	For both cases, add your spellcasting modifier to the damage as usual.

**At Higher Levels:**
* (+1) Deal 1d6 additional kinetic damage.
* (+2) Designate another creature for healing.
