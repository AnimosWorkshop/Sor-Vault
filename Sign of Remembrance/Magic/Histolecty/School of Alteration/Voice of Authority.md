#2nd-Level #Histolecty #Alteration #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: Self
- Duration: 1 hour  

You change your voice in a way that might appeal to any creature, as you gain great control over your intonation and musicality. As a part of casting this spell, and for the boon's duration as a quick action, you may use the Impress quick action. When doing so, a creature you choose who can hear you within 60' makes a Wits saving throw against your basic Persuasion (Charisma) DC. On a failure, they are charmed by you until the start of your next turn. The charmed condition counts as a curse, and the creature becomes pacified 2 until the start of your next turn.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The spell lasts for twice as long.
