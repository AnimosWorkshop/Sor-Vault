_The young man, labeled as mad and a freak just a few years before, managed to surprise everyone. By blinding his eyes, he allowed himself to ignore the images and distractions created by his afflicted mind, and open his heart to the truth._
 
You manage to make the best out of every situation. You may designate up to 2 creatures within range in addition to yourself. If any of the designated creatures are afflicted by curses, that creature receives [[Damage and Death#Temporary Hit Points|temporary hit points]] equal to 6 times the highest level among the curses, for this boon's duration.  
Additionally, whenever any of the designated creatures are afflicted by curses during this boon's duration, those creatures receive temporary hit points equal to 6 times the curse's level for the rest of this boon's duration.  
Each designated creature gets a +1 bonus to saving throws against curses, for each curse affecting them.
