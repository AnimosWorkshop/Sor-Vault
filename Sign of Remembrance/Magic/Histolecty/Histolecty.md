## Theory
 
Each living thing has within it a mind, weak as it may be, which manifests the abstruse "soul". Souls are connected between people - those we know have stronger connections, and the ones we hold dearest, or think the most passionately about, have even stronger ones. Histolects are mages which use and manipulate these very tethers between creatures to either influence their own mind and feelings, or others', to great effect.

## Measurement
 
A histolect's extent of powers is measured with Influence, with the casting approach of binding. One's influence can be used over the day to influence both the life of oneself and the lives of others, but of course that inspiration can only get you so far before refreshment. As the day progresses and the caster calls for more and more power and magic, their influence is reduced until eventually they exhaust it, and turn unable to cast spells until the following day, as they rejuvenate their influence overnight.

## Mechanics
 
Histolects can be categorized into power levels. Depending on their level, the caster's influence is higher, allowing for more spells to be cast during a day. Different spells have a different influence cost, and might require a higher level histolect in order to invoke.

### Casting a Spell
 
Every histolect gains access to the Bind quick action, which reassigns their histolectual bonds. Each bond can be assigned to a different creature other than yourself, which you can sense within 60'. The bonds hold until you reassign them, you fall unconscious, or they leave a range of 120' from you. You must be bound to a creature in order to target them with histolecty spells (unless you are the target) and have your spell effects persist on them.  
> <u>Note:</u> In order for a creature to notice that they are histolectually bound, they must a 1st level histolect or higher.
 
For some spells, you will have to determine your histolecty modifier. Use the following simple formula:  
_Histolecty Modifier_ = _Charisma Modifier_ + _Proficiency Bonus (if you are a 1st-level or higher histolect)_
 
You may also notice that some histolecty spells and magical effects require a creature to make a saving throw. The DC for that saving throw is calculated with the following formula:  
_Histolecty Save DC_ = 10 + _Histolecty Modifier_
 
After a long rest, your influence resets to the amount noted in the histolect levels table.
