#1st-Level #Histolecty #Coaxing #Curse
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 45'
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You sing to a creature within range, driving exhausting thoughts into their mind in attempt to tire them. The target must make a Wits saving throw, or have their movement speed halved for the duration, as well as losing their quick action, and having disadvantage on reaction checks. On the end of their turn, they may reattempt the saving throw, ending the curse on a success.
 
**At Higher Levels:** If you cast this spell at 2nd level or higher, the target's movement speed drops to 0 instead of being halved on a failed save. In addition, you may choose another target for each spell level above 1st.
