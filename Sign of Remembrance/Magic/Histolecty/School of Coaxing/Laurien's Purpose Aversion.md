You mutter a calming ritual passed down from Laurien, in order to calm an undead creature within range with his purpose yet unfulfilled. That creature must make a Willpower saving throw. On a fail, it gains 30 calming hit points. These hit points accumulate and last for the duration, but do not count as actual hit points. Instead, if the undead is reduced below their calming hit points, they calm without fulfilling their undead purpose. If they do calm, they return to their normal personality permanently.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The undead gains 10 additional calming hit points.
