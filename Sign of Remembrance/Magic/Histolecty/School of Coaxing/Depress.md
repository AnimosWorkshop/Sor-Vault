- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 45'
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour  

You invoke a feeling of despair within a creature you can see within range by trying to get into their head. They must make a Wits saving throw, and on a failed save, they turn depressed for the duration. If a creature depressed by this effect ends its turn more than 45' away from you, it can attempt another Wits saving throw to end the effect on it. 
A depressed creature has a -2 penalty to their Intelligence, Willpower, Wisdom and Charisma modifiers, and must succeed on a Willpower saving throw at the start of their turn to: move, attack, [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl]] or cast spells for the following round.
