You ward a creature you can see within range from harm, setting a barrier of sheer awe around them. Whenever a creature attempts to harm the booned creature with an attack or an action or spell requiring them to make saving throw, the enemy must succeed on a Willpower saving throw or fail automatically. On a success, the attacker gets a +3 bonus to the attack roll if the trigger was an attack, or the booned creature gets a -3 penalty to their saving throw.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The bonus to attack rolls and the penalty to saving throws decreases by 1, down to 0.
