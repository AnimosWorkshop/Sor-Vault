#4th-Level #Histolecty #Coaxing #Curse

- Casting Time: 1 hour
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 24 hours
- Exhausts by 3 

You touch an unconscious creature, using their state as leverage to take ahold of their mind. The target must make a Willpower save, or have their mind be controlled over by the caster. The target becomes receptive for simple instructions, which it will attempt to do for the curse's duration. The target is still affected by its natural instincts, such as sleep or hunger, and will attempt to take care of them within the limitations of the instructions even if not instructed to do so, especially their survival instincts and fear of danger.  
If exposed to danger - such as taking an amount of damage higher than a quarter of their hit points, and after each long rest they complete, the target makes an additional Willpower save, ending the curse.  
In the end of the curse, the target does not retain any memories from the curse's duration, and they are not accessible using Imbue Memory and other magic.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The curse lasts 3 times longer for each spell level above 4th.
