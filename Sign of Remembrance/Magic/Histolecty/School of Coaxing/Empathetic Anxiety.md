- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30'
- Duration: 1 minute  

You infuse a target creature with feelings of empathy towards its allies, then corrupt it with constant worry. The target must make a Wits saving throw. On a fail, whenever an ally they can perceive within 30' of them takes damage, they take a half of the damage as sensory damage as well, and whenever an ally they can perceive within 30' of them fails to use an action on their turn due to conditions, they lose their quick action and 1 reaction. After each trigger of this curse, they may attempt another Wits saving throw as a reaction, ending it on a success.
