## Spell Components
 
Spells require two components in order to be cast: a verbal component - a string of words, phrases or syllables that chain together, and a somatic component - a gesture with one's hands that would allow the magic to flow correctly. In a technical sense, that means that the caster must be able to speak audibly throughout the spell's casting and that one of their hands must be free, or holding a [spell focus](Spell%20Foci.md).
 
### Material Components

Objects which must be present within the spell's range in order for the spell to be cast. The spell description usually notes what happens to the material components as it the spell is cast.

## Meaning
 
### Spell Level

Each spell has a level, which is the lowest level the spell can be cast at. As noted in the appropriate caster pages, a character must be at a certain caster level in order to cast spells of any given level. The general rule is as follows: to cast spells of level X, the caster level must be at least 2*X - 1.  
Getting caster levels can be done in one of two ways. The common and standard one is by taking caster class levels, and the extremely rare one is by the Blessing of the Successor - one given to the current reigning gods, and to the successors who are supposed to succeed them during the next verse - the next age of the world.
 
### Magic Type

There are three types of magic in Sign of Remembrance:

- [Arcana](Arcana.md) - spells which control space using the Arcane Web
- [Auramancy](Auramancy.md) - spells which control living creatures' biological processes using their aura
- [Histolecty](Histolecty.md) - spells which control creatures' souls using the bonds between them

To cast a spell of a specific magic type, one must be a caster of that type: either an arcanist, an auramancy or a histolect. More information about these caster types can be found in the appropriate casting page.
 
><u>Note:</u> If a racial feature or a magic items allow you to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability (indicated by "this feature counts as a â€¦ for the purpose of magic detection"), you may only add your proficiency modifier to the spellcasting bonus if you are a 1st level caster or higher of the spell's magic type. For example, a water nymph may only add their proficiency modifier in the Alluring Song racial feature if they are a 1st level histolecty or higher. It also means that they are unable to use that feature without being able to provide the verbal and somatic components.
 
### Spell School

Spells are categorized into 10 schools of magic, each containing spells which are related to an aspect of magic which is the common denominator between spells of that school. Culturally, most mages tend to lean towards one school more than toward others, though no limitation is present on which spells one can learn. The schools are as following:

- Alteration - relating to the changing of matter, and body. Specialists of this school are called alterers.
- Augury - relating to fate and foresight. Specialists of this school are called augurs. This school was invented by Vorona, the Oracle, who lived since the beginning of the First Verse, and became a god of the Second Verse.
- Calefaction - relating to extreme heat and cold. Specialists of this school are called calefactor. This school was invented by Doeth, the Cold King, who lived during the First Verse.
- Coaxing - relating to the changing of mind in a forcing manner. Specialists of this school are called coaxers, and it is limited to histolecty.
- Decay - relating to death and dangerous substances, such as acid and poison. Specialists of this school are called decayers.
- Displacement - relating to manipulation of space. Specialists of this school are called displacers, and it is limited to Arcana.
- Illusion - relating to the manipulation of perception and creating false impressions. Specialists of this school are called illusionists.
- Puppeteering - relating to the fine manipulation of objects from afar. Specialists of this school are called puppeteers, and it is limited to Arcana. This school was invented by Margaret Royd, who lived during the start of the Second Verse, and has left the specialists of her school as a closed society, allowing study of the school only to those who are related by blood.
- Summoning - relating to the summoning of elementals, which are manifestations of magic in creature form. Specialists of this school are called summoners.
- Tempest - relating to the aspects of storm, lightning and thunder. Specialists of this school are called tempestists.
 
### Spell Rarity

There are three rarities of spells:

- Common - spells are common unless stated otherwise. That means that they are relatively well-spread around the world, and just about any scroll merchant might offer a scroll for them unless they are specialists. It would be logical, then, for even a newly-created character to have already learned those skills.
- Uncommon - denoted by the Uncommon keyword under the spell's normal keywords. The spell is known to individuals around the world, who can share their secrets, but will often choose not to due to religious, social or moral reasons, such with the [Imbue Life](Imbue%20Life.md) spell. Though any character _can_ learn them, it's advised to think of a good reason for why they do, or who taught them - which might lead to interesting plots.
- Rare - denoted by the Rare keyword under the spell's normal keywords. The spell is known to few, but unlike uncommon spells, it's due to the spell being granted only as a reward from a blessing or another special source. Rare spells cannot be taught to others, nor can they be transcribed onto scrolls or items.
 
### Duration

How long a spell's effects last.

- Concentration - Some spells and features require you to maintain your concentration on them. You can only concentrate on one spell or feature at a time, and breaking your concentration will end it. Whenever you take damage, make a Resilience save with a DC of either 10 or half the damage taken to your hit points (whichever is higher). You may also use a reaction at any time to end your concentration early, and if you do, the spell ends as normal.
### Casting Time

How much time is required to cast the spell.

- Just like any action, spells can be held until a specific thing happens - triggering using the caster's reaction, but holding a spell requires you to maintain concentration until it is cast. If a creature readies a spell but does not use it, the magic is not spent as the spell was not cast.
- If the caster of the spell is dealt damage while casting it, they must make a Resilience save for concentration on the spell as if they were concentrating on it. On a fail, the spellcasting resources are spent but the spell does not take effect.
- Spells with a casting time of "channel" require two actions to be used: one to start the channel, and another one to finish the channel, casting the spell. Between the two actions, the caster must maintain concentration, similar to casting spells over multiple turns (for example, with casting time of 1 minute).

Note that the two actions don't have to be on consecutive turns: they can be in the same turn (with the use of [[Fighter#Adrenaline Surge|adrenaline surge]]) or up to a whole minute after the first casting action.  
The duration of a spell with channel casting starts only from when the channeling is finished.

- If a spell requires a casting time of above 1 round (for example, 1 minute), it is required to spend an action and a quick action each turn for the spell's casting time in order to cast the spell.
 
### Range

How far a spell can go, or how far the targets be in order to affect them. There are several types of area targetting:

- Sphere - a sphere around the point originally noted. The number of feet noted is the radius of the sphere.
- Cone - a cone originating at the caster, spanning 90 degrees. The number of feet noted is the cone's height.
- Cube - a cube originating at the point roiginally noted. The number of feet noted is the length of the cube's sides.
 
### Exhaustion

Similarly to how weapons can break when you critically fail with attacking using them, you can exhaust your magic by misusing it. Whenever you critically fail a spell attack roll, you gain one exhaustion level with that magic type, reducing your spellcasting modifier by 1 with that magic type. At 3 exhaustion levels with any one magic type, you cannot cast spells of that type until you reduce it to at most 2. Whenever you finish a long rest, you may remove 1 exhaustion level from any one magic type.  
Some spells also inflict exhaustion on the caster (and their coven) of some degree to of the spell's magic types. If so, it is written in the spell's page. You cannot cast a spell which will bring you to above exhaustion level 3.
