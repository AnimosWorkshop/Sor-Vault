- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self (40' sphere)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 
- Material Components: 0.5 liters of dust of any one type of material (soil, wood, metal) within range

You conjure a storm centered around you, sending your chosen dust into a whirl. The storm must be maintained actively, requiring you to use your quick action on each turn, otherwise the storm ends on the end of your turn. Using a quick action this way allows you to add another type of dust into the storm. If you move while the spell is active, the storm moves with you, continuing to center around you. Depending on the materials currently in the storm, it can have certain effects:
* Soil - Other creatures within the storm are [[Injuries#Blinded|blinded]], and the storm is considered [[cover]] 1 for creatures outside of it.
* Wood - Other creatures which enter the storm or start their turn within its radius must make a Resilience saving throw, taking 2d8 slashing damage or half on a success.
* Metal - Other creatures have their movement speed halved while within the storm.

When the storm ends, if it is done willingly by you, the dust may be inserted into an empty container of your choice. Otherwise, it is dropped onto the ground before you have a chance to control it.

**At Higher Levels:**
* (+1) The storm's radius is 5' larger.
