You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction.  

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesnâ€™t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is not [[Conditions#Encumbered|encumbered]], who must be within 5' of you when you cast this spell.
 
If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 3d6 kinetic damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.
