#1st-Level #Arcana #Displacement #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Quick action, or 1 reaction while falling
- Range: 20'
- Duration: Until the end of your next turn  

You utter a quick spell and distinguish up to 4 creatures within range. While the boon lasts, the targets take half as much fall damage as they normally would, and their jump distance is doubled, as a force opposite to gravity is applied to them.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) You may choose another creature.
