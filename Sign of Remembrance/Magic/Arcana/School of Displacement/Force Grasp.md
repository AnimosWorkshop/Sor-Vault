You use a great amount of force to pull a creature or object of weight up to 300 lb toward you, disorienting their balance. If the target is a creature, they must make a Resilience saving throw, taking 8d6 kinetic damage or half on a fail. 
If the target is failed their save or is an object, they are moved up to 30' horizontally (your choice), applying half the original damage to the first creature or object hit in the way.
