You attempt to throw a creature close to you off-balance by sending a burst of force at them, sending them away from you. The target must make a Resilience save or take 4d4 force damage and be knocked away 10' from you. On a successful save, the creature endures the force instead, only taking half as much force damage and not being knocked away.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The target takes 2d4 additional force damage and is knocked away 5' further.
