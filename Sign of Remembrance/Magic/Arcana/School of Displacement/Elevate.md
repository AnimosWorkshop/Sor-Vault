- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60'
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes.  

The air around a creature or loose object gets lighter and lighter, as a force field makes it rise vertically up to 20 feet. While suspended, the target has no momentum of its own and a creature may grab on to other objects in order to move as if climbing. You can use your action to move the target or change its altitude by up to 20 feet up or down, as long as it remains within range. If the target is you, you can change your altitude as part of your movement each turn. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 lb.  

If the target wishes to remain on the ground, they must succeed at a Resilience saving throw. They may repeat the save in the end of each of their turns for the curse's duration to end it early.  
If the target is not already on the ground when the spell ends, it drifts safely down.
