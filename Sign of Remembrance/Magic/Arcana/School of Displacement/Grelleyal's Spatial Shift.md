#4th-Level #Arcana #Displacement #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Self
- Duration: Until the end of your next turn
 
You disappear from your position, converting yourself into essence spread thinly enough across the Arcane Web to move around freely for the boon's duration. You may use your regular movement, but you are not perceived by other creatures, nor can you be affected in any way by them or by environmental effects save for physical barricades. You may also move through creatures, though you cannot end your turn in another creature's space, or you are pushed out of it to the closest position and take 1d10 force damage. You may also not target things which are not yourself during the spell's duration.  

At any time during the boon's duration, you may use a quick action to violently manifest yourself again. All other creatures within a 30' sphere centered on yourself must make a Resilience saving throw, taking 6d8 force damage and being pushed away to the beyond the sphere. On a success, the creature takes only half the damage and is not pushed.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The force damage increases by 1d8.
