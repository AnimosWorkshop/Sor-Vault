You violently disperse all air in the sphere with a violent ripple in the Web, causing creatures and objects to be sent away by the shockwave. Each creature within the sphere makes a Resilience saving throw. They are dealt 3d8 force damage and are pushed out from the sphere and additional 5' away. A creature who succeeds the save is instead dealt half the damage, and isn't pushed.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) Each creature is dealt 1d8 additional force damage.
