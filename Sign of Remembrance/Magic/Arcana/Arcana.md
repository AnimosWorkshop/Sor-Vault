## Theory
 
Almost every inch of the multiverse contains magic, the fabric of our very reality interwoven with glands and strings of arcane magic. Like spider webs, arcane contains both symmetry and elegance, and it encompasses so much to the point of being inescapable, which earned it the name: the "Arcane Web". Arcanists - the users of arcana, emit vibrations through the web to amplitudes of great magical effects, which can be sensed, seen and felt in the various worlds.
In some places, the arcane web might be strongly imbued with magic, creating [[Arcane Field|arcane fields]].

### Measurement
 
Arcana is measured by resonance, which is related to the intensity of the vibrations sent through the Web. The larger the amount resonance an arcanist can control, the stronger and more frequent their spells are. Many aspire to control greater resonance, and be able to bring upon great effects.

## Mechanics
 
Arcanists can be categorized into power levels. Depending on their level, the caster's resonance amount and strength is higher, allowing for more spells to be cast during a day. Different spells have a different minimal resonance, although spells can be cast using a higher resonance.

### Casting a Spell
 
In order to cast a spell, you must use up resonance equal or higher than that spell's level. The amount of resonance you have of each level is detailed in the arcanist table.
 
For some spells, you will have to determine your arcana modifier. Use the following simple formula:  
_Arcana Modifier_ = _Intelligence Modifier_ + _Proficiency Bonus (if you are a 1st-level or higher arcanist)_
 
You may also notice that some arcana spells and magical effects require a creature to make a saving throw. The DC for that saving throw is calculated with the following formula:  
_Arcana Save DC_ = 10 + _Arcana Modifier_
 
After a long rest, your resonance resets to the amount noted in the arcanist table.
