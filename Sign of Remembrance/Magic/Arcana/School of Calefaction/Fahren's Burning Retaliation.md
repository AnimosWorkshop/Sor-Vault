#4th-Level #Arcana #Calefaction #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute  

You enchant a creature with the the ability to bend the web around them, signalling danger to anyone during to attempt to harm them. 
For the boon's duration, whenever the creature is damaged by another creature, or they are targeted by a curse from another creature, the enchantment tethers the harming creature as well, forcing them to roll a Wits save. They take 2d8 fire damage, or half on a success. On a failed save, the booned creature also receives a +1 bonus for the next attack roll against the harming creature. This attack bonus does not stack against the same creature.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The harming creature takes 1d8 additional fire damage and the booned creature's attack bonus is increased by 1 for each spell level above 4th.
