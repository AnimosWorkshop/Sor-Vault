_Freezing Hell is not an easy place to live in, which proves truer the further you go back in history. Despite the beautiful lakes and crystalline caves, explorers are always reminded that they venturing down the icy depths should never be done at night, as the ceiling is something that should be watched at all times._
 
You select a point you can see within range. Energy focuses at the point, before a chunk of hardened ice materializes from under it and disorients any who stand in its way, evaporating quickly after. 
Each creature in a 20' wide, 20' high cone from under the selected point must succeed on an Initiative saving throw, taking 5d6 bludgeoning damage and 5d6 cold damage, or half on a success. In addition, all creatures in that area are pushed away from the stalactite, either downward or sideways if there is no clear path down. The stalactite then evaporates into mist.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The bludgeoning and cold damage increase by 1d6 each for each spell level above 4th.
