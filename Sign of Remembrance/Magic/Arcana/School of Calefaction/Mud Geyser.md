#3rd-Level #Arcana #Calefaction
 
- Casting Time: Channel
- Range: 120' (20' sphere centered around a point on the ground)
- Duration: 1 hour  

You heat up the ground and meld it over a channeling period. After your first casting action, all creatures within the sphere's radius must make an Initiative saving throw, as the ground around them moves towards the center of the sphere, creating a ball-shaped mud blob. Each creature who fails falls prone, and takes 4d6 piercing damage. When you finish your channeling, each creature within the sphere's radius must make an Initiative save as the mud blob erupts, taking 4d8 fire damage, or half on a success. The ground within the radius then turns into difficult terrain for the spell's duration.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The mud's eruption damage is increased by 1d8.
