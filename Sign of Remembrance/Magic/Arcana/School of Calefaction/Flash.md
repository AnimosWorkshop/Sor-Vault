#3rd-Level #Arcana #Calefaction
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: 25' cone
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You cause light to originate from the edge of your hand in a sudden flash, attempting to blind all creatures within range. Each creature must make a Resilience save, or take 2d8 radiant damage and be [[Injuries#Blinded|blinded]] for the duration. In the end of each of their turns, an affected creature may reattempt the Resilience save, ending the effect on a success. 

>[!note] 
>The blindness is not a curse, since it originates from a physical source - the physical trauma of the flash to the eye, in the same way scars from a fire spell aren't curses.
 
**At Higher Levels:** When a creature fails the initial save, they take 1d8 additional radiant damage for each spell level above 3rd.
