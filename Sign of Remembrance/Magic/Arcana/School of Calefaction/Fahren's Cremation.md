- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 45' (10' sphere)
- Duration: Instantaneous  

Gesturing towards the body of a dead or undead creature you can see within range, a puff of flame bursts from it, damaging nearby creatures and relieving you. Each creature in a 10' sphere centered on the body must make an Initiative saving throw. If the body belongs to an undead, they make the save with disadvantage. Each creature then takes 4d8 fire damage, or half on a success, and you recover 1d8 hit points.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The fire damage and the hit points recovery increase by 1d8 each.
