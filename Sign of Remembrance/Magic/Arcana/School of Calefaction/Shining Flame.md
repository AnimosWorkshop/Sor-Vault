You heat or cool a point near you to an incredible degree, than turn it less harmful by letting most energy come out of it as either magical light or dark, shining up to 30' away. The flame is levitating, Tiny in size, and can be moved up to 25' in a non-crossing path you can see within 30' of you by using a quick action. Creatures moving in the flame space may evade it easily, but through moving it you may cause a creature it passes through attempt an Initiative saving throw or take 1d4 fire or cold damage, depending on the temperature. Each creature may be damaged once by the flame each turn.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The flame deals 1d4 additional damage.
