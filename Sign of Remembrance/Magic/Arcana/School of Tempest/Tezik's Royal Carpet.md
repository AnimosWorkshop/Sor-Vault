#3rd-Level #Arcana #Tempest #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour  

You call upon the winds to serve you, making them carry a creature you touch as they will them to. The creature can physically walk on air if they wish to, but doing so uses their walking speed. An unconscious creature falls as they normally would.
 
**At Higher Levels:** You may target another creature for each spell level above 3rd.
