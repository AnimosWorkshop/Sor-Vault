A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 3d4 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use a quick action to deal 1d4 lightning damage to the target. You may not use this quick action damage on a round that your target further than 30â€™ from you or has [[cover]] 3 from you.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The damage increases by 1d4.
