You send an electric ripple which spreads on the ground and atop solid surfaces. You may designate a number of creatures you can see or touch (including yourself), up to half your arcana modifier. Each other creature within range which doesn't fly must make a Resilience saving throw, or take 3d10 lightning damage and fall prone. Each creature who succeeds the save takes half the damage instead.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The lightning damage increases by 1d10.
