As [[Gods List#Venandi - God of Curiosity|Venandi]], god of travel of the 2nd verse, has traveled the world, he noticed patterns in the world, and how magic is imbued in and symbioses with space itself. Akin to the sprawling of flowers amidst quiet, grassy plains, he named the phenomenon _arcane fields_. During his travels, he tried to characterize these fields, not by a matter of divisibility and reproducibility as sorcerous scientists did, but in the descriptive language he knew.

### Categories of Fields

* **Volatile Fields** - These fields contain an amount of energy to great to contain, leaving only two options: spreading and bursting. Spreading is considered the less harmful of the two, diffusing outward to the encapsulating space; Bursting, however, is a most dangerous phenomenon which must be handled with caution or be run away from altogether. It is a hypothesis by the god that the cataclysms create natural volatile fields, though the experiments able to be made for it are expectedly scarce.
* **Excitable Fields** - These fields are usually dormant, but should never be mistaken for being nonactive. [[Arcana|Arcane spells]] made in excitable fields can cause side effects, attracting or repelling magic, due to a rapid decay of the energy from the field back onto the environment.
* **Fated Fields** - Having their name chosen as an inspiration from, but not in relation to, the goddess of fate Vorona, these fields do not innately absorb or disperse energy until they are _unraveled_. Upon unraveling, fated fields can behave as either of the above types and sometimes differently as well, as they are _raveled_ with a purpose.

## Arcane Field Effects

### "... and the Earth Answers"

#Fated #Excitable

Upon unraveling, the field directs some of the flow of magic down toward to the earth, reducing the Arcana modifier of creatures within by 1; and also reacts to arcane spells being cast within. Upon casting an arcane spell, roll a flat check.
* 1 - The dust flies all over, obscuring your vision and preventing you from acting properly. You are pacified 2 until the end of your next turn.
* 2-5 - The dust coalesces, but you fail to repel it, instead having it hit you. You take 1d4 + $\text{Int mod.}$ bludgeoning damage.
* 6-10 - You control the dust, but only weakly so. A 5' by 10' area of ground within 20' of you becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.
* 11-19 - You coalesce the dust and manage to repel it in a direction of your choice. Make an arcane spell attack, with a 1d4 damage die.
* 20 - You manage not only to coalesce the dust, but maintain it. If you see a ranged attack being made within 20' of you, you may use a reaction and make an arcane spell attack with a 1d4 damage die, and the DC being the opposing attack roll. On a hit, you reduce the attack's roll by 2, and it deals less damage equal to your damage roll.
