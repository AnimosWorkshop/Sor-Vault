#4th-Level #Arcana #Puppeteering
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: 40'
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes  

You take over a set of clothing or a suit of armor. If it is unattended, you may use it as a minion which takes up the form of how the clothing is supposed to be worn - and you may command it with your voice to move up to 30' per and perform a major interaction per round, and if it includes gloves even perform fine movements such as opening a flask's cork. Your magic bolsters the clothing, making it resistant to tear and other kinds of damage.  

However, if the clothing is attended, the creature wearing it may take a Resilience save in order to resist the magic. On a fail, you may command the clothing with your words, making it do one of the following movement options:

- Stride - move up to 15' in a direction of your choice, forcing the creature's movement with it
- Drop - drops the wearer prone.
- Halt - your control over the clothes becomes stronger, making the next Resilience save the creature has to make against this spell be made with a -2 penalty.

For as long as their armor is possessed, you may use a free action on your turn to command the clothing with your voice. The wearer is stunned but may attempt a Resilience saving throw in the end of each of their turns. On a success, the creature manages to seize control over their clothing, ending your control over that set of clothes.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+2) You may take over an additional set of clothing.
