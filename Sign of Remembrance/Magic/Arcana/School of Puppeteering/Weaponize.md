You touch a small object weighing no more than 0.2 bulk, and cause it to become a weapon for you using an ethereal tether, allowing you to swing it around using your arcana modifier. The object serves as a melee weapon you are proficient with of the Hurler style, having light weight, the [[Weapon Rules#Finesse|finesse]] trait and dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the object is destroyed, the spell ends.
