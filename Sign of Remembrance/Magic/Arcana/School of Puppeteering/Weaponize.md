You touch a small object weighing no more than 2 lb, and cause it to become a weapon for you using an ethereal tether, allowing you to swing it around using your arcana modifier. The object serves as a melee weapon you are proficient with of the Hurler style, having light weight, the [[Weapon Rules#Finesse|finesse]] trait and dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the object is destroyed, the spell ends.  
 
**At Higher Levels:** The weapon's damage die increases by 2 for each spell level above 1st.
