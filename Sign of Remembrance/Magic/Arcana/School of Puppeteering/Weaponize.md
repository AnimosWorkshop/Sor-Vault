#1st-Level #Arcana #Puppeteering
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You touch a small object weighing no more than 2 lb, and cause it to become a weapon for you using an ethereal tether, allowing you to swing it around using your arcana modifier. The object serves as a melee weapon you are proficient with, having the Light and Finesse trait and dealing 2d4 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the object is destroyed, the spell ends.  
If you have the [[Fighter#Arms Specialty|Arms Specialty]] feature, it counts for the Hurler's weapons group.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The weapon's damage die increases by 2 for each spell level above 1st.
