You create a whip of water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage, and you can knock it prone and pull it up to 25â€™ closer to you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't pull it or knock it prone.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The target takes 1d8 additional bludgeoning damage.
