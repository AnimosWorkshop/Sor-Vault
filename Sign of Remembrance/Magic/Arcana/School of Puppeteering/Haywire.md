- Casting Time: Channel
- Range: 45'
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
- Material Components: A strong rope or wire at least 20' long  

Uttering a word of command and sending a rope forward, you cause the wire to be launched onto a large or smaller creature or object. The rope deals 3d4 bludgeoning damage to the target, and the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained. On the end of each of its turns, the restrained creature takes 3d4 additional bludgeoning damage.  
Any creature within melee range of the restrained creature, including the restrained, may use an action to reattempt the save, ending the restraining on a success and dropping the rope on the ground. On each of your turns, you may use an action to throw the rope onto another creature or object if both the rope and the target creature are within your range. You may also use an action to tighten the rope to deal 3d4 bludgeoning damage.  
When the spell ends, any restrained creature is freed from the rope, ending the restraining and dropping the rope on the ground.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The target takes 1d4 additional bludgeoning damage.
