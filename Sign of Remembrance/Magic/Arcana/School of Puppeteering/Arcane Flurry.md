You focus momentarily on your surroundings, then unleash a series of bends to the arcane web to push and pull on different locations, allowing you to perform any combination of up to 4 actions, each being either a major interaction action or a [[Action Economy#^1e684d|disorient quick action]] consecutively, as if your reach was the spell's range. The DC against these disorient actions is your spellcasting DC, and you are considered to be making them with a free hand.
