- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 20'
- Duration: Instantaneous  

You focus momentarily on your surroundings, then unleash a series of bends to the arcane web to push and pull on different locations, allowing you to perform any combination of up to 4 actions, each being either a [[Action Economy#^30b3a9|major interaction]] or a [[Action Economy#^1e684d|disorient quick action]] consecutively, as if your reach was the spell's range. The disorient actions use a [[Dice Rolls#^ec0c90|basic]] [[Dice Rolls#Mixed Checks|mixed]] (spellcasting, Sleight of Hand (Dexterity)) DC, and you are considered to be making them with a free hand.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) You may perform an additional action.
