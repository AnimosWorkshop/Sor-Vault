A weapon you touch is infused with energy which causes it to be directly connected to your will. You guide the weapon as it strikes, and are able to enhance its movements so long as you can see it. While the weapon or its wielder is within your line of sight, you are able to give attack and damage rolls with that weapon a bonus or penalty up to third of your arcana modifier.
