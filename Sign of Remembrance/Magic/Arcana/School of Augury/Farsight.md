#3rd-Level #Arcana #Augury #Boon
 
- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: Self (5 miles)
- Duration: 1 hour  

You declare out loud a place you know well within the spell's range. Focusing on the ritual and imagining the place in your mind, you get a clearer picture of what the place looks like from a stationary observant's point of view. For the boon's duration, you can get a 360 degrees view and sound of the place from the point you chose, using a quick action to substitute between your senses in your body, to your senses in the spell's point.  

The point remains in place as boon still holds, yet you can move normally, even as you sense from the other point. You may cast this spell more than one time to hold multiple points of view using the spell, yet may sense from only one at a time.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The spell's duration and range are doubled.
