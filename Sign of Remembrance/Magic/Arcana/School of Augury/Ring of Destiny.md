#5th-Level #Arcana #Augury
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 8 hours  

You manifest a small ring in the palm of your hand. Any creature holding it may put it on their finger as a quick action, and the ring magically adapts to their size. The ring glows with a faint white aura, is warm to the touch, and may bear a symbol of your choice.
 
A creature wearing the ring may use their reaction when they fail a saving throw, shattering the ring in a burst of light. The creature automatically succeeds the save. Alternatively, they may use up the ring as a quick action to end a curse on themselves of 5th level or lower which lasts up to 1 day. However they choose to use it, they get 30 temporary hit points for the next hour after the ring shatters.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The ring can remove a curse of 1 level higher and grants 5 additional hit points when shattered.
