- Duration: 24 hours
- Exhausts by 1  

You manifest a vision of peace, rendering attacks ineffective. The area within a sphere around your current position becomes a peace zone for the duration, granting all creatures -4 to attack and damage rolls, and increasing their attacks' Fragile property by 4, while they are within the zone.  
The zone persists even if you don't stay within it.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The attack and damage roll reduction and the Fragile property potency increase by an additional 1 for each spell level above 4th.
