* Casting Time: Action
* Range: 45'
* Duration: Instantaneous

You are able to get an immediate understanding of your surroundings, connecting all lines in a moment. You perform any combination of up to 4 actions, each being either a [[Action Economy#^3d44e8|search]] action or an [[Action Economy#^047348|assess]] quick action, with [[Dice Rolls#Mixed Checks|mixed]] (spellcasting, the appropriate skill) check. You may use a reaction after casting this spell to convey the information to one creature who would be able to hear and understand you within range.

>[!note]
>The information is not transmitted telepathically, but audibly, albeit too quite for anyone aside from the creature you choose. Therefore, spells like [[Silence]] stop this part of the spell.

**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) You may perform an additional action.
