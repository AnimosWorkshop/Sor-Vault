#2nd-Level #Arcana #Augury #Curse
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: 60' (5' cube)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute  

Creatures contained in the area of the cube within range must make a Willpower saving throw, or be affected by the curse. Those creatures are anticipated to do nothing for as long as the curse affects them, meaning that they take 1d12 force damage for each action, quick action, movement (all movement counts 1 time) or reaction they take. The cursed creatures may attempt a Willpower saving throw on the end of their turn, ending the curse on a success.
 
>[!note] 
>The spell lasts on the creatures, not on the area.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The size of the cube increases by 5' for each spell level above 2nd.
