#2nd-Level #Arcana #Augury #Boon 
 
- Casting Time: 10 minutes
- Range: Self
- Duration: 1 hour 

You meditate, focusing on the arcane web and the infinite possibilities lying beyond the butterfly effect, looking for foresight for an upcoming event that will happen in the next hour. Asking will reveal one of the following omens according to the current circumstances (if no further preparations would occur):

- Weal - If things will turn out well
- Woe - If they will turn out badly
- Weal and Woe - If both good and bad
- Nothing - if nothing particularly good or bad will happen

Having foresight about the event allows you to intuitively perform better towards that goal. For the boon's duration, you have a +2 bonus to skill checks and DCs regarding the event you foresaw.
 
>[!example] 
>Looking for foresight about a heist you are about to perform will yield an omen, and the different skill checks, such as Sleight of Hand and Deception checks to aid your success in the heist, will be made with a +2 bonus.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The spell's duration is doubled.
