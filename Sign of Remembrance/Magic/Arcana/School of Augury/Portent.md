#3rd-Level #Arcana #Augury #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Self (30')
- Duration: 1 minute  

You look into the future and shoot for a possibility. Roll 2 d20's. For the duration, you may use your reaction to switch the result on a d20 a creature within range rolls with one you rolled. If the creature is unwilling, they may attempt a Willpower save to resist it. Each die used is spent for the remainder of the spell, and once all dice are spent, the boon ends.  
For each d20 not used until the boon ends, you receive 1 sensory damage, as you irritate the gods of fate.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) You may roll an additional d20 to use until the boon ends.
