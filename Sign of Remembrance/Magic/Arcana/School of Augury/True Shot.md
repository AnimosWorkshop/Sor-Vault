As you're shooting, you call upon fatal power to aid your shot and bring forth raw power upon your enemies. Make your ranged spell attack against a creature within range, with the Lethal 3 property added to the attack. On a hit, it deals additional 1d20 + 1d12 + 1d10 + 1d8 + 1d6 + 1d4 radiant damage and applies 1 breakage level to the creature's armor, or 2 breakage levels on a critical hit. On a miss, it deals the damage excluding the 1d20 to all creatures within 5' of the target in a bright explosion.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The lethal property is increased by 1 for the attack.
