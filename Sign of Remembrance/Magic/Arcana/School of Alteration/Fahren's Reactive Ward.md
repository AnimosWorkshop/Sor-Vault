- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 10 minutes

You cast a quick enhancement on an object you touch, allowing it to block upon need. As a reaction to a melee attack or touch spell being used on the creature holding the item while the spell is active, the enemy takes a -1 penalty to the attack roll or to their spellcasting DC in the case of a touch spell.
The aggressor must also make a Willpower saving throw, and take 1d6 kinetic damage on a fail.
The ward may be used this way up to 3 times before the spell ends.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The ward may be used an additional time.
