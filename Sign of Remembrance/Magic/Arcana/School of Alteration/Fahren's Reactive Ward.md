#1st-Level #Arcana #Alteration
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 10 minutes

You cast a quick enhancement on an object holding, allowing it to block upon need. As a reaction to a melee attack or touch spell being used on the creature holding the item while the spell is active, the enemy takes a -1 penalty to the attack roll or to their spellcasting DC in the case of a touch spell, and they must make a Willpower saving throw. On a fail, they take 1d6 force damage.
The ward may be used this way up to 2 times before the spell ends.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The ward may be used an additional time for each spell level above 1st.
