Mustering every shard of strength you find in the environment, you generate an strong ward, hopefully one durable enough to bear incoming blows. The ward takes damage before the damaged creature for its duration, but does not count as temporary hit points. The ward can take up to 3d12 hit points before dissipating.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The ward can take up to 1d12 more hit points before dissipating.
