You distort the Arcane Web in such a way that doubles the gravity in an area of a cube, centered on a point you can see within range. Objects in that area weigh twice as much, usually rendering the creatures within the cube [encumbered](Conditions.md). In addition, objects within the cube count as being one weight category higher than usual - light objects are considered medium, and medium objects are considered heavy. The area also counts as difficult terrain, and the distance projectiles travel is halved through the well.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The cube's size increases by 10'.
