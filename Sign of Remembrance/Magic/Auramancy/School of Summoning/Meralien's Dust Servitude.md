#1st-Level #Auramancy #Summoning
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60'
- Duration: 1 hour  

You manipulate the force between dust particles in order to create a somewhat shapeless, yet living, force of servitude, which can perform simple tasks for you.
 
Once on each of your turns as a quick action, you can mentally Command the servant to move up to 15' and make a Major Interaction. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, etc.. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next Command.
 
If you Command the servant to perform a task that would move it outside of the spell's range, the spell ends.
