#1st-Level #Auramancy #Summoning
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 1 minute
- Material Components: A thick branch or a medium or heavy wooden weapon  

You awaken a thick branch into a whip in your hand. As you attack with it, vines spread from it to your target, hardening to form a stable rope for you to pull them with. Make a melee spell attack within 15' reach against the creature. On a hit, they take 3d4 slashing damage, and if they are up to one size larger than you they must also succeed on a Resilience save or be pulled to melee range with you.  
When you hit with the attack or when the duration ends, the branch or weapon return to their original form.
 
**At Higher Levels:** You deal additional 2d4 bludgeoning damage for each spell level above 1st.
