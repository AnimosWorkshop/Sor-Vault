#4th-Level #Auramancy #Summoning
 
- Casting Time: Channel
- Range: Touch
- Duration: Instantaneous  

During your first casting action, you manifest in your hand a small blossom, with its petals rather closed as if to protect its core. While a creature holds the flower, they have a +2 bonus to their AC and saving throws, which may be increased to +3 until the start of that creature's next turn using a quick action. When you finish your channeling, the blossom blooms violently - dealing 3d8 necrotic damage with noxious fumes to any creature within 5' of the flower except for its holder, who instead recovers 4d8 hit points.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The necrotic damage and healing are increased by 1d8.
