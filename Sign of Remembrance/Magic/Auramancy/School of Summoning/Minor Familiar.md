#2nd-Level #Auramancy #Summoning
 
- Casting time: Action
- Range: 30'
- Duration: 8 hours  

You use up aura from nearby and transmute it into a minor familiar that spawns in a point you can see within range. This familiar lasts for the duration, in the end of which it dissolves back into the surrounding area.
 
You may use a quick action in order to see and hear through your familiar's eyes as long as they are within 120' of you. While sensing through them, your own body is both [[Injuries#Blinded|blinded]] and deafened, until you use another quick action to go back to your senses instead of your familiar's.
 
The familiar's turn comes after yours, allowing you to command it with your words, even if it can't hear you, and you can use your action to cast a spell with touch range from the familiar's range instead of yours, given that they succeed on a reaction check if you are within 120' of it. You may also attempt to command the familiar to use a reaction by making a reaction check for both you and for your familiar.
 
The familiar's stats are as follows, and its form is that of a tiny animal you have previously seen. When it drops to 0 hit points, it vanishes.
