#1st-Level #Auramancy #Summoning
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: 30'
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You use a small amount of mana quickly and inefficiently in order to create a weak elemental. After the spell's duration, the elemental dissipates back into the environment.
 
The familiar's turn comes after yours, allowing you to command it with your words, even if it can't hear you, as long as it is within 120' of you. The familiar's stats are as follows, and its form is that of a tiny bipedal mote of energy of the element of your choice (fire, cold, lightning, poison or acid). When it is dropped to 0 hit points, it vanishes.
