- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30'
- Duration: 1 minute  

You call upon flora to grab a creature you can see within range. They must succeed on a Resilience saving throw or become [[Conditions#Grappled|grappled]] by the plants. On each of their turns, they may use a [[Action Economy#^30b3a9|major interaction]] to attempt to break the grapple, with the escape DC being equal to your auramancy save DC.  
The flora have an AC and maximum hit points equal to your save DC, and don't have resistance to: Slashing, Fire or Poison damage. They have an immunity to Psychic damage, and resistance 2 to all other damage types.  
The flora wilt if the target succeeds on their saving throw, if they are lowered to 0 hit points, or if the spell ends.
 
**At Higher Levels:** While in range, you may use a quick action to strangle the target, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each spell level above 1st. The flora also have 6 additional hit points for each spell level above 1st.
