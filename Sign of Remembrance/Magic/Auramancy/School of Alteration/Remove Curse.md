#1st-Level #Auramancy #Alteration
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action / 10 minutes
- Range: Touch
- Duration: Instantaneous
- Material Components: If cast over 10 minutes - medicinal herbs worth 10 sc * this spell's level
- Exhausts by 1 if cast over 10 minutes  

You draw out both the aura out of yourself and the creature you attempt to relieve in order to attempt to end a curse of this spell's level or lower.

* If this spell was cast over an action and quick action, the lifting is doable only if the curse's remaining duration is up to 24 hours.
* If this spell was cast over 10 minutes, then it requires the material components and exhaustion, but the lifted curse may be of any duration.

If the casting is successful, then the creature makes three saving throws against the curse's original save DC, each of them with advantage.  
On each fail, the creature loses hit points equal to the gap between their roll and the curse's DC. If they survive on more than 0 hit points, the curse is lifted.
