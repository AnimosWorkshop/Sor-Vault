- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours  

You engulf a creature's body with hardened scales, warding them from incoming attacks. Their AC increases by 1 for the duration. If an attack would cause you to lose concentration on this spell, the armor shatters in a 5' line in the direction of the attacker. A creature standing in that space must make an Initiative saving throw or take 1d10 piercing damage from the debris.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The piercing damage increases by 1d10.
* (+2) The creature's AC increases by an additional 1.
