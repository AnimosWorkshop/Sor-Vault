#1st-Level #Auramancy #Alteration #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Self
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You alter the fingers of some or all of your hands to sharp claws. While your hands are in this form, you may not hold items, but your unarmed attacks have their damage die increased up to 1d6 in addition to be able to deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.
You may use a quick action to revert back to your fingers' normal form, or convert them back, while the boon lasts. You may also convert them back into claws as a part of an attack action, similarly to drawing a light weapon.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The claws' base damage die increases by 1 for each spell level above 1st.
