You use a large amount of aura to nullify another creature's uniqueness. A creature within range must succeed on a Resilience saving throw, an Initiative saving throw, a Wits saving throw and a Willpower saving throw.  
For each failed save, the creature's relevant attribute become 10 for the purpose of anything which relies on this attributes' modifiers save for hit points, known proficiencies and class requirements, but it does affect [encumbrance](Conditions.md).  
Each save may be reattempted in the end of each of the cursed creature's turns.
