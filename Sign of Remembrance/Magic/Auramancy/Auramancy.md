## Theory
 
The origins of auramancy are as old as the first creature, as an aura engulfing and swirling inside its body was, itself, sufficient to create the thing we call "life". This aura causes a creature to feel physical sensations, act upon instincts, and do whatever the body needs to be more than an object - but a living creature. All creatures, from the lowliest insect to the mightiest god possess such aura, even [[Unlife|undead]].

## Measurement
 
The power of auramancy is measured by mana. Auramancers each have their spare mana, which is the amount of mana they may use while remaining stable. Pushing beyond one's limit is an art known only by few, and is obviously considered dangerous to the one using it.

## Mechanics
 
Auramancers can be categorized into power levels. Depending on their level, the caster's maximum amount of mana is higher, allowing for more spells to be cast during a day. Different spells have a different mana cost, and might require a higher level auramancer in order to invoke.

### Casting a Spell
 
In order to cast a spell, you must use up mana equal to some spell level's cost, as detailed in the [[#Spells Mana Cost|above table]]. The amount of mana you have of each level is detailed [[#Auramancer Levels|here]].
 
Next, you will have to determine your auramancy modifier. Use the following simple formula:  
_Auramancy Modifier_ = _Wisdom Modifier_ + _Proficiency Bonus (if you are a 1st-level or higher auramancer)_
 
You may also notice that some auramancy spells and magical effects require a creature to make a saving throw. The DC for that saving throw is calculated with the following formula:  
_Auramancy Save DC_ = 10 + _Auramancy Modifier_
 
After a long rest, your mana resets to the maximum amount, noted in the auramancer levels table.
