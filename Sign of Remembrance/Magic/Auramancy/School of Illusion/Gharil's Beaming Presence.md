You enhance your body to exude magical pheromones which cause creatures around you to notice you more easily, for better and for worse. For the boon's duration, you may use your Auramancy modifier instead of your Intimidation (Charisma) modifier for the Demoralize quick action, and instead of your Performance (Charisma) for the Inspire quick action. In addition, you may make one of those quick actions once each turn as a free action each turn.  
When you take these as a free action this way, the bonus or penalty to the next attack roll is reduced by 2.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The bonus or penalty to the next attack roll on free actions made with this spell is reduced by 1, up to no reduction.
