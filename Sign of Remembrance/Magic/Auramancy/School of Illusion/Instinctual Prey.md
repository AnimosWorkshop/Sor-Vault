- Range: 30'
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 

You instill fear within up to 2 creatures that can see you within range, causing their instincts to perceive you as a predator. Each creature must make a Wits saving throw, or be unable to move towards you and have disadvantage on attacks while you are within their sight. On the end of their turn, they may attempt another Wisdom saving throw, ending the curse on a success.  

>[!note] 
>Treat the field of view as 180 degrees, meaning that standing on the opposite side of the creature's target does not impose disadvantage on their attacks.
 
**At Higher Levels:**
