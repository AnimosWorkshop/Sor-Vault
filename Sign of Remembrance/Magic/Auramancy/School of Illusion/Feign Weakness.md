You make your body seem less durable than what it actually is, making you seem as if bruises you get are tougher and blood is shed earlier than it does in reality, using manipulation of biological processes to stall the actual damage. Therefore, You seem to other creatures as if your maximum hit points is lower by 12 + your auramancy modifier (but at least 1 maximum hit points). When you are supposed to be reduced to 0 hit points, you may fall prone as a free action, and creatures within 30' may make a Wits saving throw to discern the illusion. Any creature who failed is surprised by you until the end of your next turn.
