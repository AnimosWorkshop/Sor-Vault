You unwind a mental spool as you go, allowing you to instinctually recall and even visualize the course in which you've traveled since starting to cast this spell. Using an action, you may remove from your trajectory any loops, i.e. parts of your course which start and end on the same point. You may also spend 1 minute to share your spool with a creature you touch, allowing them to see it as well for the next 10 minute or until you lose concentration.

**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) You have a +1 bonus to concentration saves for this spell.
