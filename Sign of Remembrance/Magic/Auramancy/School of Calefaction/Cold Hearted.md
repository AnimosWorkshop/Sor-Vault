- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 1 minute  

You touch a creature, causing their heart rate to drop lower, rendering them exhausted. The creature must make a Resilience saving throw. On a fail, they take 3d10 cold damage and become [tired](Conditions.md) for the curse's duration. On a success, they take half the damage instead and do not become tired, ending the curse. A cursed creature may repeat the save on the end of its turn, ending it on a success.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The cold damage increases by 1d10.
