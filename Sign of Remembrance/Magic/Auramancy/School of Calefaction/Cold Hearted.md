_A spell made as a mockery of, and not in honor to, Doeth. Though after the cataclysm he will have gained favor by the eyes history, for the rest of 1V the dead king's legacy remained present only in hushed conversations._

You touch a creature, causing their heart rate to drop lower, rendering them exhausted. The creature must make a Resilience saving throw. On a fail, they take 3d10 cold damage and become [[Conditions#Fatigued|fatigued 2]] for the curse's duration. On a success, they take half the damage instead and do not become fatigued, ending the curse. A cursed creature may repeat the save on the end of its turn, ending it on a success.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The cold damage increases by 1d10.
