#2nd-Level #Auramancy #Calefaction #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Quick action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 1 minute  

You cause a creature to exude fire from their body, which can be concentrated while focusing on certain actions. The booned creature starts with 1 charge, and may hold up to 4 at a time. Whenever they cast a spell, attack or use a [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl action]] for the boon's duration, they build up 1 additional charge. However, charge generation does not stack within the same action (i.e. any number of attacks as a part of a spell's casting count as gaining 1 charge).

As a quick action, they may release any amount of gathered charges against a creature within 10' of them as a spell attack using their auramancy modifier, dealing 1d8 per charge on a hit. The creature may hold up to 4 charges.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The booned creature may hold an additional charge.
