#2nd-Level #Auramancy #Calefaction #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: Touch
- Duration: 1 minute  

You cause a creature to exude fire from their body, which can be concentrated while focusing on certain actions. Whenever the booned creature attacks or uses a [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl action]] for the boon's duration, they build up fiery charges around them. Attacks, [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl actions]] and spells generate 1 charge, although charge generation does not stack within the same action (i.e. an attack as a part of a spell's casting counts only once).

As a quick action, they may release any amount of gathered charges against a creature within 10' of them as a spell attack using their auramancy modifier, dealing 1d8 per charge on a hit. The creature may hold up to 4 charges.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The booned creature may hold an additional charge.
