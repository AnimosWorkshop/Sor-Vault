You engulf yourself in flames, and force yourself upon a creature within range. They must make a Resilience saving throw or become [[Conditions#Grappled|grappled]] and restrained by you, as if you had used the grapple and restrain actions, in addition to taking 4d10 fire damage. In the start of the grappled creature's turn, they take 1d10 fire damage. The boon ends early if the enemy succeeded on the initial save, or breaks free of the grapple.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The initial fire damage increases by 1d10.
