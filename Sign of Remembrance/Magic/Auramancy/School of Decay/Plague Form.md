#4th-Level #Augury #Decay #Boon
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: 15'
- Duration: 10 minutes  

You transform a willing creature's body to be ridden with plague, while bolstering their body against it. For the boon's duration, the creature gets a +2 bonus to Resilience saving throws, and poison and necrotic damage resistances. In addition, when a creature comes in contact with them during an action made by the booned creature or the other creature - either during a melee attack, a touch-ranged spell or an action requiring contact such as brawl actions, medicate or administering a potion, they spread some of the decay to the other creatures. The creatures in contact must make a Resilience saving throw, taking 2d6 necrotic damage on a fail and becoming [[Conditions#Decaying|decaying]] until the end of their next turn.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The necrotic damage increases by 1d6.
* (+2) The Resilience save bonus increases by +1.
