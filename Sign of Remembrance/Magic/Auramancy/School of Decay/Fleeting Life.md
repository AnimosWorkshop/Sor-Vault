Life is ever fleeting, and you use auramantic decay to tug at a creature's condition right before it believes it has gotten to safety. The creature is afflicted by the lost condition for this curse's duration, and must succeed on an Initiative save or be affected by an additional condition among: [weakened](Conditions.md), [fatigued](Conditions.md) or [[Conditions#Decaying|decaying]].
