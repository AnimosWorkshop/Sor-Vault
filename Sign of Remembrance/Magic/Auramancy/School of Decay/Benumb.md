You set your hand out, and a flash of concentrated energy travels forth towards a creature's limb. That creature must make a Resilience saving throw, or take 1d6 necrotic damage and have a limb of your choice become numb.

- If you target a hand or a limb that holds an item, that item is dropped and the creature can't hold items, attack or cast spells with that limb.
- If you target a leg or a limb that the creature moves with, the associated movement speeds are divided by 2. If a creature has more than one limb affected this way, it is divided by 2 for each.

**At Higher Levels:** 
* (2nd) Upon failing the save, each creature takes 1d6 necrotic damage for every numbed limb.
* (+1) You may target another limb, of the same creature or another.
