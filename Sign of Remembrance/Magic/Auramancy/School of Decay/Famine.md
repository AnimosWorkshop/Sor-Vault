- Duration: 1 week
- Exhausts by 1  

You cast a ritual on a creature to make their belly constantly ache, asking for food yet never having enough. Even food which is supposed to more than satisfy the creature won't suffice, and they'll slowly degrade into exhaustion. 

The target must make a Resilience saving throw, or be cursed for the duration. They don't feel much during the first hour, but then become [[Conditions#Fatigued|fatigued 2]] for the remainder of the curse. At the start of each passing day until the curse's end, the creature loses 5 maximum hit points, which can only be recovered by ending the curse.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The curse lasts twice as long.
