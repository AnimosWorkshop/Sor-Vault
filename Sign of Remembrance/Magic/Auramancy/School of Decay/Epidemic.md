You attempt to start to spread an epidemic from a creature you choose within range. That creature must make a Resilience saving throw, or become afflicted with the curse - having the [[Conditions#Decaying|decaying]] condition and the [pacified](Conditions.md) 2 condition. As long as the spell persists, you may use a quick action on your turn to force another creature, at most 15' from a cursed creature, to make a Resilience save or be afflicted with the curse as well.
 
**At Higher Levels:** 
* (+1) The pacified condition is increased by 1.
