## Upcasting
 
Upcasting is the act of casting a spell at a level higher than its base one. When using an upcasting of a spell, it usually gains additional effects, indicated by a "**At Higher Levels:**" paragraph in the bottom of the spell's page. If no additional effects are noted, casting the spell is virtually identical to casting it at its base level.
* If the bullet point says "(X) ...", then the additional effect takes place when the spell is cast at least at level X.
* If the bullet point says "(+Y) ...", then the additional effect takes place _for each_ Y spell levels above base level.

## Compound Casting
 
Compound casting is used for compound spells, which have more than one magic types. The spellcasting ability for compound spells is the highest of the magic types used, and during the casting both spell costs are expended in the same time. All requirements for both magic types must also be fulfilled.  

>[!example] 
>In order to cast Nullify Intentions at 1st level, one must both use a 1st-level resonance and 2 mana.  
>It should be noted that spell currencies used must be equal, and determine the spell level in which the spell is cast.

## Coven Casting
 
Not all mages work alone, which turns out to be a good thing, as magic can be amplified using sheer numbers. The sorcerous term to describe this is called "coven casting", and it is fairly common in magic-reliant societies and organizations.
 
In order to coven cast, All casters must start their casting in the same round, and hold the casting of the spell until the last one finishes - in which point every caster besides the last use their reaction to amplify the spell. The last caster, who doesn't use their reaction, is called the "catalyst" in sorcerous literature, and is the one responsible for the spellcasting ability used for the spell. The reaction for casting a spell uses the previous reaction DC, meaning that if no reactions were yet performed when releasing the spell the DC is 0, if one reaction was used the DC is 10, and so on. The reaction DC does not rise after releasing the spell.
 
Each caster must be at most 15' away from another caster coven casting the same spell.
 
### Coven Upcasting
 
Upcasting can also be done by coven casting. In order to do that, each caster must use the spell as if from the same level (so for example, of the same resonance). The total number of casters required to upcast is multiplied by 2 for each level above the one used to cast the spell: 2 to raise it by 1, 4 to raise it by 2, 8 to raise it by 3, etc.
 
### Coven Compound Casting
 
Coven casting can also be used to cast a compound spell, in which casters of the same or different magic types can use a compound spell together to cast it.
