Spells are a very complex matter to handle, as they are extremely precise in assembling and invoking. The most powerful casters of history have researched magic for years upon years to even come close to the act of creating their own spell, yet due to the sheer number of mages all around the multiverse, a new caster will never have "enough" books to file all of their research in.
 
Learning a spell is a process with a few steps:

1. Obtain a [[Runecarver#Spell Scrolls|spell scroll]] of the spell you want to learn.
2. Learn the spell over a downtime period (as specified in Mechanics: Downtime Training), finalizing the learning of the spell and consuming the scroll.
 
A creature may learn any number of spells, even those they cannot cast given their caster levels, and knowing a spell might help in identifying it as it's being cast by another creature or realizing in the aftermath of the spell what exactly happened in a location. Learning a spell is also a necessary step in creating a spell scroll of it.
