Martial classes are experts of using non-magical means in order to increase their prowess and fight like no other. They are usually able to both tank incoming damage and deliver powerful blows in special and awe-inspiring ways, perfecting their form in order to get over any obstacle. Part of that prowess comes from different techniques, passed on from generations long-past who have tried to achieve this very goal.

## Learning Techniques
 
Each class which is fully martial gains the Martial Techniques feature every even level. More often than not, techniques will be class-locked, as each type of warriors assembled their own techniques specialized for them. In order to perform a technique, one must obtain themselves a manuscript detailing that technique. Since in contrast to learning spell scrolls, a scroll needn't be consumed in order to learn its contents, manuscripts run much cheaper than their counterparts.

| **Technique Level** | **Cost (sc)** | **Training Duration** |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Basic               | 20            | 1 DP                  |
| Advanced            | 60            | 2 DP                  |

## Preparation
 
Although one may learn any number of martial techniques from their class (or general techniques), the number of techniques that can be prepared per day is determined by the Martial Techniques feature in the class. Preparation must be done over after every long rest, and takes 5 minutes per basic technique or 10 minutes per advanced technique. Once a technique is chosen, it is considered "prepared", and may be used throughout the day. Replacing a prepared technique requires 20 minutes for a basic technique and 40 minutes for an advanced technique.

## Performance
 
Techniques involve using a particular skill in order to outperform regular moves. This skill is depicted in the specific technique, alongside a DC. When a technique is performed, one should attempt a skill check - which results in the technique working on a success, or not on a failure. Even if the technique fails, the ordinary move - whether be it an attack (only a weapon attack), an action, etc., are executed as normal.  
You may not use multiple techniques at the same time if both involve making an attack as a part of them.

## Crafting Manuscripts
 
The crafting of manuscripts is detailed in the [Crafting](Scrolls%20and%20Manuscripts.md) section. It should be noted that one must know a technique in order to write a manuscript detailing it.
