#Basic #Trickster #Movement #Time
 
- Performance Time: 2 reactions to being attacked by an enemy you can see
- Success DC: Acrobatics (Dexterity), DC 12
- Movement Cost: 5', or 10' if prone or on difficult terrain
 
Reacting to an incoming attack you can see, you may use the Dodge reaction to a fuller extent, moving much more than you normally would. That causes you to move 5' towards a direction of your choice, and increases the AC bonus granted by the dodge reaction by 2. This movement does not provoke [[Action Economy#Opportunity Attacks|opportunity attacks]].
