#Basic #Trickster #Armed 

- Performance Time: Attack action
- Success DC: Sleight of Hand (Dexterity) with the target's basic Initiative DC
- Required Weapon: Any weapon with the [[Weapon Rules#Thrown|thrown]] trait

You make a careful throwing attack, grazing your target in a way that catches their clothes or shoes in the ground. The damage die is reduced by 1 for the attack, but the target is [[Conditions#Grappled|grappled]] by your projectile. They must use a [[Action Economy#^359f07|minor interaction]] in order to remove it, ending the grapple.
