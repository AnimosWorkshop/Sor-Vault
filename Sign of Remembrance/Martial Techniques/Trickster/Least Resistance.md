- Performance Time: 2 reactions to being attacked by an enemy you can see with higher combat initiative than you
- Success DC: Acrobatics (Dexterity), DC 20
- Movement Cost: 10'
 
As an extension to the Dodge reaction, you let your body flow with an incoming blow to generate less resistance to it. If the attack hits, the attack knocks you back 10', but you lower the attack's damage roll by one and a half times your Dexterity modifier. This still allows you to use your Uncanny Prediction feature.
