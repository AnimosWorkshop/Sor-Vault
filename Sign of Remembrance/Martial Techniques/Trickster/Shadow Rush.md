#Basic #Trickster #Movement
 
- Performance Time: 2 reactions to having attacked a creature while [[Conditions#Hidden|hidden]]
- Success DC: Stealth (Dexterity), DC equal to your previous [[Action Economy#^284a7e|hide]] check
- Movement Cost: 5'
 
You attempt to sequence your actions to maintain stealth for as long as possible. If you succeed on the technique, you reduce your previous Stealth (Dexterity) from your hide check by 4, but retain the [[Conditions#Hidden|hidden]] condition against all creatures except for your attacked target unless they use 2 reactions or a quick action to alert about your position.
