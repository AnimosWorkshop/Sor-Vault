As you make your attack, you imbue your blow with sheer rage, coming down onto your opponents. The attack deals 2 less damage on a hit, but the creature must move up to 5' away if they are able to, which might trigger [[Action Economy#Opportunity Attacks|opportunity attacks]]. On their next turn, their movement is reduced by how much they moved.
