Targeting an enemy who was dealt piercing damage from a projectile since the end of your last turn, such as from: bolts, shards of an [[Alchemist#Bombs|alchemical bomb]] or a thrown dagger, you use your weapon to deliver a calculated strike and drive the projectile further.
If you succeed on the technique, make your 2 attack rolls against the target.
* If both rolls would hit, the attack deals its regular damage, plus the projectile's damage. This breaks the projectile (flat DC 11).
* If only one would hit, the attack deals only its regular damage.
