Targeting an enemy who was dealt piercing damage from a projectile since the end of your last turn, such as from: bolts, shards of an [[Alchemist#Bombs|alchemical bomb]] or a thrown dagger, you use your weapon to deliver a calculated strike and drive the projectile further.
If you succeed on the technique, make your 2 attack rolls against the target, as if with advantage.
* If both rolls would hit, your attack deals its regular damage, plus the projectile's damage. Then, make a flat check to not break the projectile, with a DC according to its standard breakage chance (DC 2 for non-fragile weapons, DC 11 for arrows and bolts, etc.). 
* If only one would hit, your attack deals only its regular damage.
