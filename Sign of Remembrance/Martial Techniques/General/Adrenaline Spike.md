- Performance Time: 1 attack
- Success DC: Medicine (Intelligence) or Medicine (Wisdom), DC 12
- Required Weapon: Dagger, blowgun or dart

Aiming toward a specific point in your target's body, you attack in such a way to make it feel painful but not harmful. On a success, if the attack hits, the attack deals only half the damage, and gives the target a +1 bonus to saving throws. If the attack critically hits, it instead deals no damage and the save bonus is increased to +2.
