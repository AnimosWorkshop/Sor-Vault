You throw or shoot a projectile directed near a creature's limbs in a way that hinders their movement and causes them to get stuck in a surface. On a success, the attack's damage die is reduced by 2, but the target must use half their base movement speed to free themselves. If the attack critically hits, the enemy had to spend their whole base movement to free themselves instead.
