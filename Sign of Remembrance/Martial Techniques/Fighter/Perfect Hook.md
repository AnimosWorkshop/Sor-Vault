When your guard is via from the [[Fighter#On Guard|on guard]] feature, if the attack made against you is a melee weapon attack, you attempt to disarm the wielder entirely instead of blocking the attack. If you succeed on the technique, the attacker must make a Resilience save against the skill you chose, dropping the weapon 5' away on a failure. On a success, the attack's damage is reduced by half, before the guard's damage reduction.
