- Performance Time: Quick action
- Success DC: Athletics (Strength), DC 10
- Required Weapon: Hook
 
You use your hook to reel in an opponent and expose them. Make a weapon attack with your hook as a quick action, meaning you do not receive an attribute modifier bonus to damage rolls. As a light weapon, you may choose to use your action to attack according to the dual wielding rules.
If you hit, any attacks you make against the hooked creature until the end of your turn have a +1 bonus to the damage rolls and the Lethal 1 trait.
