#Basic #Sentinel #Time
 
- Performance Time: Attack action and quick action
- Success DC: Nature (Wisdom), DC 13
 
When you make your Attack action, you pay an additional attention to the target's stance and potential weak points. If you succeed, the first attack you hit is made against the target's natural armor regardless of their worn armor. On a critical hit, [[Armor Rules#Armor Breakage and Weaknesses|breakage]] is still applied to the worn armor if applicable (according to the target's worn armor weakness).  
If you are in Offensive Stance using the Stance feature, you also have a +1 bonus to your attack roll.
