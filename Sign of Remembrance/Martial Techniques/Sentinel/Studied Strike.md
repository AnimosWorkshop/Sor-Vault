When you make your [[Action Economy#^941070|attack]] action, you pay an additional attention to the target's stance and potential weak points. If you succeed, your attack is made against the target's [[Armorer#^0e737f|natural armor]] regardless of their worn armor, but not disregarding shield bonuses. On a critical hit, [[Armor Rules#Armor Breakage and Weaknesses|breakage]] is still applied to the worn armor if applicable (according to the target's worn armor weakness).
