#Basic #Sentinel #Armed
 
- Performance Time: [[Action Economy#^5d5dd0|Shove]] action
- Success DC: Intimidation (Strength) with the target's basic Resilience DC
- Required Weapon: Unarmed strike (legs)

You perform a powerful shove with your leg, throwing them backward. If you succeed on the technique, you immediately perform a shove (without a saving throw from the target), and the shove throws them back 5' further than the usual shove action. This is considered an unarmed strike, which means it has the [[Weapon Rules#Light|light weight]].
