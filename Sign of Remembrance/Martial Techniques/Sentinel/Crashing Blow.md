#Basic #Sentinel #Armed
 
- Performance Time: 1 attack
- Success DC: Athletics (Strength), with the target's basic Resilience DC
- Required Weapon: Any combination of knuckles and unarmed (2-handed)
 
You lash out with both hands to deliver a powerful blow from above against your opponent. The attack uses the maximum of your damage options (between knuckles if equipped or unarmed) with the damage die increased by 1. Your attack is performed as such regardless of succeeding on the maneuver DC. 
This counts as a medium weapon attack.
In addition, if you succeed on the maneuver DC and the attack roll,  you knock the target prone on a hit if they are of your size category or smaller.
