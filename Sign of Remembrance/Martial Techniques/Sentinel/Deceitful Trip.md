You extend your [[Sentinel#^843c5c|deflect]] reaction to deceive your foe by exaggerating your movement. On a success:
* You increase your [[Sentinel#Grazing Style|grazing range]] by 1. 
* If the incoming attack grazes you, you have a +1 bonus for your Athletics (Strength) modifier for [[Action Economy#^b70e3f|brawl]] actions against the attacker until the end of your next turn.
