#Basic #Sentinel #Movement #Time 

- Performance Time: 2 reactions to being attacked in melee range
- Success DC: Deception (Charisma), DC 10
- Movement Required: 10' from the next turn
 
You extend your Deflect reaction to deceive your foe and use their momentum against them, using exaggerated maneuvers. On a success, if the attack misses, the attacker must make a Resilience saving throw against your basic Deception (Charisma) DC or fall prone.
