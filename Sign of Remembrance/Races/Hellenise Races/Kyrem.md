_Kyrems are well-known for their able bodies, which allowed them to adapt into the three kyrem subraces, each fit for a specific part of Hell. The culture of kyrems contains various kinds of symbolism of balance, which will be familiar to anyone who fluently speaks the Hellenise languages, as well as various mentions of the Hellenise_ _ancients. As such, many kyrems decide to pursue the divine arts, at least as a tradition if not as bona fide theurges._
