**To Hell and Back:** Once per long rest, as a quick action, you may teleport up to 30' if you have a clear line of sight to that point. In the same round, you can use your reaction to go back to where you teleported from if you still have a line of sight to that point, but doing so prevents you from taking more reactions during that round as a lethargy takes over your body. This feature counts as a 2nd-level, arcana, displacement for the purpose of magic detection.
