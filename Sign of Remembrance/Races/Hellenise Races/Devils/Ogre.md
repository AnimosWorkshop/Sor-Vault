## Subraces
### Mystic Ogre
 
_A rather rare subrace of ogres, they live in small groups and wonder from place to place. They are proud of their affinity towards Arcana, and are glad to show it to whoever dares oppose them on their journeys. In their eyes, they are the proof that sometimes brain and brawn are able to be within the same person without compromise, and shame those who display neither._
 
**Racial Attribute Bonus:** Your Intelligence score increases by 2.  
**Quick Analysis:** You are proficient with Sorcery and are novice with Insight.  
**Tremor:** You slam the ground and channel energy into it, causing it to quake in a 5' radius centered on you. Any other creature in range must succeed at an Initiative saving throw or fall prone, receiving 2d4 bludgeoning damage from the trembling. This counts as a 1st-level, arcana, tempest for the purpose of magic detection. You may only use this feature once per long rest.
 
### Scaled Ogre
 
_Scaled ogres live in and near the volcanos of Burning Hell. Their bodies, a big bigger than mystic ogres', are also especially resilient and covered with scales, which allows them to better withstand the pests and aggressive animals contesting this territory. With the "heat of the mountain", their ancestors created powerful blades, and passed on the art of smithing to their children - who proudly take their place as worldforges._
 
**Racial Attribute Bonus:** Your Constitution score increases by 1.  
**Scaled Body:** Your natural armor AC is 13 and you may only add half your Dexterity modifier for its AC calculation instead of your full Dexterity modifier. Its weaknesses are piercing and cold damage.  
**Worldforge:** You are proficient as a Smith, and are novice with Athletics.
