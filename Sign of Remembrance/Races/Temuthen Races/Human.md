_There is not much to say about humans - they are usually a part of any population, and adapt to the local cultures of most of the mixed settlements. They are usually loyal to authority while trying to break free as much as they can, and just, well - be humans, as humans usually are._  
_Humans don’t have subraces as much as they have people with different learning capabilities - and the separation of the two allows that both flavorfully, as well as mechanically._

- Strength - Whenever you critically hit, add double your proficiency modifier to the damage dealt of the same type as the one you deal. If the attack deals multiple damage types, use the one that dealt the most damage.
- Dexterity - Your walking speed increases to 35', and opportunity attacks are made with disadvantage against you.
- Constitution - Your maximum hit points increases by a number equal to half of (your level + 1), and have an advantage against being poisoned.

- Willpower - Once per short rest, you may choose to succeed on a Willpower save for a reaction check (before rolling).
- Wisdom - You gain a bonus to initiative rolls to determine turn order equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't be surprised while conscious.
- Charisma - After another creature within 15' attempts a Charisma ability check but before the results are announced, you may use your reaction to bolster their argument. Make a the same check as them with disadvantage, and you may replace what you rolled with what they rolled. You may only use this feature once per short rest.
