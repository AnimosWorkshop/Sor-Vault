>Dragons are a lot stronger than traditional player characters. This page serves as a consistent guideline to how to create dragons, but the use of them in parties is generally discouraged because of their imbalance relative to the other players. Despite this, wyrmlings are the closest in power level to regular player characters, and can be used if taken into account.

**Age:** Wyrmlings (akin to children-adolescents) until their 40s, then youngs (akin to young adults and adults) until 90s, and adults (akin to middle-age and elderly) until their 160s. Elders can live up to the age of 400, but usually die sooner due to blood wars or direct inheritance.

**Breath Weapon:** Each dragon has their own breath weapon, which they can use with an action to unleashing an element within them in a cube in front of them, 15' as wyrmlings and 5' more for each age category above it. Each creature within that area must make a Initiative saving throw in the case of: fire, cold and lightning, or a Resilience saving throw in the case of necrotic and acid. The DC is 10 + your Willpower modifier + your proficiency modifier. The breath weapon deals 3d8 of the dragon's element, and 3d8 more damage for each age category above it, or half as much damage if the creature succeeds on the saving throw. You regain the use of this feature once per short or long rest.  
**Of the Elements:** Wyrmlings are resistant 1 to their element; youngs are resistant 2, and adult and elder dragons are immune to the damage type of their element.

## Draconic Archetypes
 
_Each 'dragonflight', or draconic subrace, have a general biological similarity determined by a metallic or chromatic archetype. Each archetype has five dragonflights in it, though their biological similarity doesn't imply a social similarity at all._
 
### Chromatic
 
**Chromatic Scales:** Your natural armor AC is 13, plus 1 for each age category above wyrmling. While using your natural armor, you may only add half your Dexterity modifier for AC calculation instead of your full Dexterity modifier. Your unarmored defense weakness is piercing damage.  
**Shapeshift:** Once per short rest, you may transform your body into the shape of a creature, of your size or up to two size categories smaller. You may retain this form as long as you are conscious, or until you dismiss it using a quick action. Any items you hold or wear, either in your original form or the transformed form, might either be torn from the pressure of the transformation (in the case of transforming into something larger) or dropped (in the case of held items or transforming into something smaller. The shapeshifting is mostly visual, and so you retain your attribute scores even while transformed.
 
### Metallic
 
**Metallic Scales:** Your natural armor AC is 16, plus 1 for each age category above wyrmling. While using your natural armor, you may not add your Dexterity modifier for AC calculation. Your unarmored defense weakness is bludgeoning damage.  
**Battleform:** Once per long rest, you may use your quick action to transform your body to a more battle-honed form, granting you a bipedal form while maintaining your natural armor, head and wings. You may retain this form as long as you are conscious, or until you dismiss it using a quick action. Your limbs become longer and you stand upright, and you may hold weapons and shields using your hands. Your size category remains the same, but your mobility increases - granting you a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws.

## Dragonflights
 
_Ten dragon kinds, or 'dragonflights', were created by Anthros in the First Verse. Each of them had a specialty - an agenda which lead their dragonflight to shape the territory ruled under them into what it is over the Second Verse, both in physical form - terrain and climate, and in social form - how the society developed to fit a certain archetype, with the elder focusing their efforts on maintaining the dragonland's well-being, and its society in check._
 
### Black
 
_The evasive black dragons are natural spies and infiltrators, and their society shaped itself to become this way.

Ever since, the Copper Dragonland, located in eastern Sadeenver, was forced to quickly turn into a kingdom of the people - Copperland, housing the most ambitious cooperation between a dragonflight and humanoids Temuthan had ever seen.

### Gold
 
_The gold dragons are great managers believing in a hierarchy on top of which they are placed. Some say that a part of this was further reinforced by Gharil, the August, who was politically, though not biologically, considered the elder dragon after slaying the previous one in his times. So, in their dragonland, located in Bulawan, the dragonflight makes sure everyone knows who rules it, part of which coming in the form of increasing unhealthy competition within the humanoid communities living in it._

### Green
 
_The green dragons have great curiosity, and even greater suspicion. Their tendency to not overlook small details managed to evolve the dragonflight's society to be very risk-aversive, keeping strangers out and closely inspecting its own members.

### Silver
 
_The silver dragons see themselves as superiors to other races in the power their race gives them - both a draconic and bipedal form, supreme will and ability, and kindness. To their underlings, however, all of this is channeled in the form of care - the dragonflight sees itself as responsible for the lives of inferior beings, such as humanoids, and goes to great lengths in order to take care of them. The Silver Dragonland, located in western Sadeenver is known for its social care and supreme aid granted by even the elders themselves, though that has grown its population somewhat less inclined to go through the effort to help itself._

### White
 
_The white dragons are firm believers in the growth of oneself without any help of another. Yet, they, as superior creatures, are able to do so much more than lowly humanoids - and thus the challenges they must face are far greater than any humanoid could ever imagine. In the White Dragonland, located in the central western regions in Sadeenver, people live in small communities - only growing up the children enough to allow them to trip and fall on their own, collect their bruises until the understand the meaning of failure - and only then, of success. The dragonflight acts sometimes as mentors if an individual takes that as their call, but mostly try to harden their own body against the horrible, snowy climate, forever waiting for the next disaster to come onto them._
