_Orcs are tribal, usually living in traveling clans without clinging too much to the same place. Although their size might be a bit intimidating at first, as they are taller and heavier than most humans, they are communal and respect others. Though the overall influence of orc culture on the mixed culture might be small as a whole, few individuals still rise every once in awhile and make a name for themselves. Within their tribes, they value utmost honor and honesty, even if the individual wills to leave the clan in a future date to wander alone, or perhaps start a tribe of their own._

## Subraces
### Berserker Orc
 
_Berserker orcs are regarded by many as “barbaric” and “uncivilized”, but reality proves otherwise - and the berserker orcs’ society is organized very well, with different castes according to one’s inner ability. As they get older, their body turns into that of a fierce fighter, earning more national-leaning orcs a place of honor in militaries._
 
**Relentless Endurance:** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.  
**Savage Attacks:** Your hits always find their targets, allowing you to ignore 1 level of [[cover]] on attacks. In addition, when you critically hit with an attack, you may reroll up to 2 dice on your damage roll. If you do, you must use the new rolls.
 
### Nomad Orc
 
_Nomad orcs get their name from the traveling that is associated with them. As they are able to go from cold to hot areas and vice versa without any problem acclimatizing, their culture revolves around the endless wonder of the world, collecting memories along the path and sharing it with others, who might one day aspire to attempt their own journey too._
 
**Racial Attribute Bonus:** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.  
**Acclimatize:** You are naturally adapted to both hot climates and cold climates. In addition, you are novice with Athletics, and whenever you have to roll an Athletics (Constitution) check against [[Travel and Rest#Travel|fatigue]], you get a +1 bonus.
