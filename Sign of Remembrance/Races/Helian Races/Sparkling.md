## Subraces
### Charged Sparkling
 
**Racial Attribute Bonus:** Your Wisdom scores increase by 1. 
**Charge Release:** When hit by a melee attack, you may use a special reaction which releases some of the charge in your body unto your attacker. The attacker must make a Dexterity saving throw against your auramancy save DC, taking 2d8 lightning damage, or half on a success. This feature counts as a 1st-level, auramancy, tempest for the purpose of magic detection. This feature may be used twice per long rest.  
### Flared Sparkling
 
**Racial Attribute Bonus**: Your Charisma score increases by 1.
**Irradiating Presence**: Flared sparklings' control over Sparksong is much better than charged's, allowing them to use it in speech to capture the attention of others. You may activate this as a quick action and the use of your [[Reading a Spell Entry#Duration|Concentration]] slot. For the next 10 minutes, you have a +1 bonus to Charisma-based skill checks. While this is active, you may flare your song using an action, ending the effect entirely and dealing 1d4 radiant + 1d4 thunder damage to all other creatures who fail a Resilience save within 10'. Creatures who fail the save are also considered [[Injuries#Blinded|blinded]] against creatures who are further than 45' from them for the next round. This feature counts as a 1st-level, arcana, histolecty, tempest for the purpose of magic detection, and may be used once per long rest.
