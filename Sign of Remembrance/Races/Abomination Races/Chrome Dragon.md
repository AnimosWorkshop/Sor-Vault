>Dragons are a lot stronger than traditional player characters. This page serves as a consistent guideline to how to create dragons, but the use of them in parties is generally discouraged because of their imbalance relative to the other players. Despite this, wyrmlings are the closest in power level to regular player characters, and can be used if taken into account.

_The chrome dragons were created as a result of a conspiracy by five dragonflights: gold, brass, blue, black and white, to be the force to rival the very gods. Terrifying battle-born creatures, they are immune to most harm by the elements and are well suited for all combat scenarios. The first was born right at the Second Cataclysm, however their numbers grow, slowly but surely, threatening creatures of all realms._
 
**Racial Attribute Bonus:** 
* Your Willpower score increases by 2. If your dragonflight stat increases are going to pass 20, you may choose another stat to increase instead.  
* Two other ability scores of your choice each increase by 1, plus 1 for each age category above wyrmling, up to 20.  
**Age:** Wyrmlings (akin to children-adolescents) until their 50s, then youngs (akin to young adults and adults) until 120s, and adults (akin to middle-age and elderly) until their 240s. Elders can live up to the age of 650, but usually die sooner due to blood wars or direct inheritance.  
**Size:** Wyrmlings are Medium, youngs are Large, adults are Huge and elders are Gargantuan.  
**Creature Type:** Dragon.  
**Speed:** 30' walking, 30' flying. Your flying speed increases by 15' for each age category above wyrmling.  
**Vision:** Lightvision, mistvision.  
**Breath Weapon:** Each dragon has their own breath weapon, which they can use with an action to unleashing an element within them in a cube in front of them, 15' as wyrmlings and 5' more for each age category above it. Each creature within that area must make a Dexterity saving throw in the case of fire, cold and lightning, or a Constitution saving throw in the case of poison and acid. The DC is 10 + your Willpower modifier + your proficiency modifier. The breath weapon deals 3d8 of the dragon's element, and 3d8 more damage for each age category above it, or half as much damage if the creature succeeds on the saving throw. You regain the use of this feature once per short or long rest.  
**Of the Elements:** You are immune to the damage type of all elements: acid, cold, fire, lightning and poison.
**Persistent Anatomy:** The starting hit points of dragons changes as they age alongside with their size:
- Wyrmlings (medium): 8 starting hit points
- Youngs (large): 10 starting hit points
- Adults (huge): 12 starting hit points
- Elders (gargantuan): 20 starting hit points

In addition, your hit point maximum increases by 1, and by an additional 1 every time you gain a level.

**Metallic Scales:** Your natural armor AC is 16, plus 1 for each age category above wyrmling. While using your natural armor, you may not add your Dexterity modifier for AC calculation. Your unarmored defense weakness is bludgeoning damage.  
**Battleform:** Once per long rest, you may use your quick action to transform your body to a more battle-honed form, granting you a bipedal form while maintaining your natural armor, head and wings. You may retain this form as long as you are conscious, or until you dismiss it using a quick action. Your limbs become longer and you stand upright, and you may hold weapons and shields using your hands. Your size category remains the same, but your mobility increases - granting you a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws.
**Shapeshift:** Once per short rest, you may transform your body into the shape of a creature, in your size or up to two size categories smaller. You may retain this form as long as you are conscious, or until you dismiss it using a quick action. Any items you hold or wear, either in your original form or the transformed form, might either be torn from the pressure of the transformation (in the case of transforming into something larger) or dropped (in the case of held items or transforming into something smaller. The shapeshifting is mostly visual, and so you retain your attribute scores even while transformed.
**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write in a language of your choice.
