**Attune with Nature:** Your ties with nature allow you to be aware of how much time has past from the last sunrise.

**Conduit of Life:** While taking a short rest, you may spend one of your hit dice in order to restore hit points to another willing creature you touch equal to your Nature (Wisdom) + your Constitution modifier. You may only use this feature once per short rest, and using it does not prevent you from using other hit dice during the rest. This feature counts as a 1st-level, auramancy alteration for the purpose of magic detection.
