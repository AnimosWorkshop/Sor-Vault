### Forest Nymph
 
**Racial Attribute Bonus:** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.  
**Attune with Nature:** Your ties with nature allow you to be aware of how much time has past from the last sunrise. In addition, while touching a tiny or small beast, you can use your action to discover its physical condition, whether it is poisoned or not and damage of which type it was dealt the most during the last 24 hours.  
**Conduit of Life:** While taking a short rest, you may spend one of your hit dice in order to restore hit points to another willing creature you touch equal to your Nature (Wisdom) + your Constitution modifier. You may only use this feature once per short rest, and using it does not prevent you from using other hit dice during the rest. This feature counts as a 1st-level, auramancy alteration for the purpose of magic detection.

The target must succeed on a Wits saving throw or be charmed by you, being unable to take hostile actions against you and be forced in each of its turns to use its full movement speed to get closer to you and stay within 5' of you. In the end of each of its turns, or whenever it is the targeted by a hostile action taken by you or a creature it considers your ally, it may repeat the save. The spell ends after 1 minute or until you lose your concentration. This feature counts as a 1st-level, histolecty, curse for the purpose of magic detection.
