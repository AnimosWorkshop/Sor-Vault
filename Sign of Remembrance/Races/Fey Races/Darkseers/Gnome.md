### Wideview Gnome
 
**Seen That Before**: Whenever you fail a saving throw, you may attempt to draw knowledge about similar situations you have already encountered. Choose a skill relevant to the problem you're dealing with which caused you to roll a saving throw (according to the GM's discretion), and roll a skill check. This becomes your new result for the saving throw. You may use this feature once before needing to recover it over a long rest. In addition, you are proficient with one skill of your choice.
 
### Prism Gnome
 
**Eye of an Expert:** You are expert with a skill of your choice.
