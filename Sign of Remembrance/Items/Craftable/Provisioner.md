| Bottomless Reservoir | 70 sc    | 4 lb       | _Functionality_  <br>This pouch or waterskin with volume no more than 2 pints seems to be half-full with water, and weighs as much.

If punctured, it loses the enchantment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
