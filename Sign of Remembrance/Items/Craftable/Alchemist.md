## Methods of Administration
 
Alchemists create many substances which may have some kind of influence over a creature. In order for the substance to take effect, the creature must be exposed to it in some way, which will usually be one of the following:

- Ingest - drinking the substance or eating something which contains the substance. A substance in a flask may be consumed using a minor interaction, or a major interaction in order to administer it to a willing or unconscious creature.
	An dangerous ingested substance is also called a _poison_.
 ^17c511
- Inhale - breathing the substance for a short or long time (as specified in the specific item's description).
	A dangerous inhaled substance is usually called a _toxin_.

- Inject - having the substance put directly into the bloodstream of the creature, usually by a traditional syringe or a dart containing it. If a dart containing the substance misses, the substance is not spent, unless the dart is broken or the target succeeds on a substance's saving throw (in poisons' case). A syringe deals no damage when applied, but a dart does, though the user may choose to deal half the minimum damage instead of rolling for damage.
	A dangerous injected substance is usually called a _venom_.

>[!tip]
>Anyone who might consider using alchemical items should look for a [[Provisioner#Starting Gear|pouch]].

>[!note]
>Some bombs and venoms of higher costs are written as 'double', 'triple', etc. of an effect. That is to indicate the base damage for the transmuter class, which can increase the base damage of alchemical items when used as an attack.

When in contact with a creature's saliva or acid, the liquid evaporates quickly into gas. Exhalation is recommended as soon as possible, lest the user takes 4d10 fire damage. If a torch or another source of fire is put in front of a creature exhaling this gas using an action, a 20' cone of fire will erupt, forcing each creature within that range to make an Initiative saving throw with DC 18, taking 4d10 fire damage, or half on a success.                                             |
| Quick Husher            | 40 sc    | -        | Venom. Deteriorates over 1 week.<br>In the end of their next turn, the target must make a DC 13 Resilience saving throw against the toxin (poisoned condition) or fall asleep for the next 2 hours. A creature who succeeds on the saving throw takes 1d10 necrotic damage, and has immunity to the toxin for the next 2 hours. The toxin is consumed when the dart hits a creature. A critical hit on the attack roll increases the DC to 17.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Sticky Goo              | 4 sc     | 0.1      | Can be applied to a creature's hand to enhance their grip. Attempts to disarm the creature from it have a -1 penalty, and grappling with this (empty) hand has a +1 bonus to the DC. The affected creature may use a quick action to end the effect, or the effect ends naturally after 1 minute. If this is used to enhance grappling against a creature, the effect ends when the grapple does.<br><br>Can alternatively be placed in a flask as a [[Alchemist#Bombs\|bomb]].

| Steadying Concoction            | 4 sc     | 0.2      | Deteriorates over 1 week.<br>When injected, restores a creature with at most 0 hit points back to 0 hit points and makes them stable, as if they succeeded all of their [[Damage and Death#Death\|death saves]]. However, this stabilizing effect also makes the creature not wake up when healed with magic or alchemy, instead needing to wait the 1d4 hours as normal. Succeeding on a DC 15 Resilience save when healed negates this downside. |
