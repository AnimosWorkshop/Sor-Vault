| Dazing Wand (Histolecty)          | 160 sc   | _Functionality (Requires Attunement)_  <br>When applied to a histolectual wand, the attuned may use their quick action to force a bound target within 60' to take 1 psychic damage and make a Wits saving throw. On a fail, they lose one quick action on each of their turns until the start of the attuned's next turn. If the attuned has the Psychic Tug feature, they may choose to add the Psychic Tug's damage on failed save.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Dispatcher's Scepter (Histolecty) | 40 sc    | _Functionality_  <br>When applied to a histolectual scepter, the holder may designate a willing creature within touch range as the caster of Imbued Memory, Message, Booming Voice and Dream Intervention spells they cast, even if they didn't contribute to the spell's casting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Flaming Arc Wand (Arcana)         | 1 gc     | _Functionality (Requires Attunement)_  <br>When applied to an arcane wand, the attuned may use it in an attack action in order to perform a melee spell attack, which deals 1d6 fire or 1d6 cold damage and has the Reach trait. If you have another free hand in addition to your wand hand, the damage increases to 1d8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Foretelling Scepter (Arcana)      | 80 sc    | _Functionality (Requires Attunement)_  <br>When applied to an arcane scepter, the attuned may invoke it to use a Foretell quick action, allowing them to see glimpses of nearby incoming danger. When used, they get a +1 bonus to their AC and saving throws until the start of their next turn. The bonus is +2 instead if they have a free hand when they use this quick action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Nonlinearity Wand (Arcana)        | 4 gc     | _Functionality (Requires Attunement)_  <br>When applied to an arcane wand, it gains the ability to adapt to a resonance charged into one of two cells in the wand.<br>Each cell may be charged using one of the attuned's resonance slots over 10 minutes of concentration. <br>When you cast any spell, with the wand at hand, you may use a reaction to draw the resonance from the wand to coven cast with yourself, as if the wand was a caster. Alternatively, you may expend the resonance in the wand instead of your own to cast a spell as normal.<br>The resonance in the cells dissipates when you finish a long rest. |
| Smuggler's Inventory              | 75 sc    | _Functionality_  <br>While an item is contained inside the inventory, it is invisible by non-magical senses. The inventory appears as if it contains generic things, such as a generic hilt for a scabbard, a water bottle in a pouch, or notebooks in a backpack. This upgrade does not affect any items after they leave the inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Spellshaper's Weapon              | 2 gc     | _Functionality_<br>The weapon is infused with magic-absorbing qualities, allowing a user to charge it with magic to withdraw later. As a quick action, a creature touching the weapon while not charged may expend spell energy (resonance, mana or influence) equivalent to a certain spell level. For the next minute, the next weapon attack with this weapon which hits deals an additional damage equal 1d10 per spell level. The damage type is Force for resonance, Necrotic for mana or Psychic for influence.                                                                                                            |
| Staff of Balance (Arcana)         | 150 sc   | _Functionality (Requires Attunement)_<br>You use a self-balancing mechanism tying the staff to the web in order to maintain the flow of battle. Once per short or long rest, when you roll a natural 2 to 10 on a saving throw, you may add your arcana modifier to the natural roll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Vengeance Staff (Histolecty)      | 110 sc   | _Functionality (Requires Attunement)_  <br>When applied to a histolectual staff, whenever the attuned takes damage over their Constitution score or gets critically hit, the staff activates, granting them 3 temporary hit points until the end of their next turn, and a +1 bonus to their histolecty modifier on the next spell they cast until the end of their next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Focus Object             | 80 sc    | _Property (Requires Attunement)_  <br>The object becomes a [spellcasting focus](Spell%20Foci.md) of any one magic type, determined upon the upgrade's crafting, and therefore can receive potency and functionality upgrades accordingly. In order to receive the focus benefits, the object must be held as normally required.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Knowledge Keeping Object | 140 sc   | _Property (Requires Attunement)_  <br>While attuned to this item, [proficiency points training](Proficiency%20and%20Downtime.md) may be used to train up to 2 points towards a proficiency cap. When done so, the training is stored in the object instead of in your own memory. Then, after the object is charged with knowledge, whoever is attuned to the item is considered trained in whichever proficiencies you charged the object with without it counting towards the creature's proficiency cap. |
| Locatable Object         | 30 sc    | _Property_  <br>This previously non-magical item now becomes more easily detectable for you, allowing a creature to know this object's location using the Detect Object spell even outside of the normal 1000' range, as long as both the caster and the object are in the same realm (e.g. they are both in Temuþan).                                                                                                                                                                                      |
