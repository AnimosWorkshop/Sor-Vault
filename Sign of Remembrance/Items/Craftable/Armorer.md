| Durable Armor         | 40 sc    | 0.1 lb      | _Property_  <br>This object is more durable than others. When it would break, roll a flat check with DC 11. On a success, the item does not break.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Hardened Weave        | 40 sc    | 2 lb        | _Functionality_  <br>Upon creation, one type out of: slashing, bludgeoning or piercing is chosen, as it dictates the construction of the weave. While installed on cloth or leather armor, its wearer gets resistance 1 to the chosen damage type. This weave may be installed onto armor or clothes by an armorer.                       |
| Elemental Sink Module | 40 sc    | 2 lb        | _Functionality_  <br>Upon creation, one element out of: fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison is chosen, as it dictates the construction of the module. While installed on metallic armor, its wearer gets resistance 1 to the chosen damage type. This module may be installed onto armor or shields by an armorer.                        |
| Resilient Armor       | 2 gc     | -           | _Functionality_  <br>Any damage the wearer receives is reduced by 1 for each type that damage consisted of. This cannot mitigate loss of hit points.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Shield Boss           | 30 sc    | Adds 0.5 lb | _Property_  <br>The shield is also a weapon, which deals 1d3 damage for light shields, 1d4 for medium shields, and 1d6 damage for heavy shields. If you use the [[Fighter#Shield Bash\|shield bash]] dirty tactic, this upgrade instead increases the damage die from your shield bash feature by 1 for you.                              |
| Sterling Armor        | 50 sc    | -           | _Functionality_<br>The item cannot become dirty as easily as before, as most liquids and fine powders can be simply brushed off of it. In addition, if the item is clothing (while not wearing other armor) or non-metallic armor, the wearer becomes resistant 1 to acid damage, and the armor cannot receive breakage from acid damage. |
