Spell scrolls are special magic items which store a specific spell for a time of need. Special knowledge is needed to create them, in addition to a great skill in enchanting and the ability of spellcasting. There are two types of spell scrolls: learning spell scrolls and invoking spell scrolls.
 

## Invoking Spell Scrolls
 
Invoking spell scrolls are used to invoke a certain spell within them. Every creature that can fulfill the normal components of the spell (usually verbal and somatic) can cast the spell inside the scroll by touching it and spending the spell's casting time. The scroll is consumed in the process.

>The rules for spellcasting apply to the spell cast, e.g. casting an arcana spell without being at least a 1st level arcanist means that you won't add your proficiency modifier to the spellcasting modifier.
