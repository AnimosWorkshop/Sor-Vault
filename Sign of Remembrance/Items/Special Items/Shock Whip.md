_Property_  
When making an attack with the whip, the user may use a quick action and speak the whip's command word to discharge its power towards the chain if they are attuned to it. The whip gains a charge counter, then the user makes a flat check with the DC equal to the number of charge counters on the whip. On a success, the whip discharges towards the thong, dealing 2d12 + your Intelligence modifier additional lightning damage, and the struck creature has disadvantage on reaction checks until the start of their next turn. On a fail, the user takes 2d12 + your Intelligence modifier lightning damage, and has disadvantage on reaction checks until the start of their next turn.  
The discharge is considered to be a 1st-level, arcana, tempest, curse for the purposes of magic detection, and this item is considered a spellcasting focus for both this feature and for any tempest spells.  
A weaponsmith may attempt a DC 14 check once per day in order to reduce the charge counters on the whip by 1, up to a minimum of 2 charge counters.
