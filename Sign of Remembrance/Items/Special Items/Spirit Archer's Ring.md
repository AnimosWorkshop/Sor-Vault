_Property_  
When making an attack, the wearer may use their other hand in order to "draw" from the ring. As they do, a radiant bow apparates around the ring, and as they let go - a bolt is shot at their target. Effectively, this is a ranged ammunition (80'/320'): arrows weapon of the medium weight category, akin to a shortbow, which deals 1d6 psychic damage, and requires the hand opposite of the one the ring is donned on to be free to shoot. The attuned's attack bonus may be calculated in two ways:

- Martial - the bonus they had if they were shooting a regular shortbow
- Histolectual - their histolecty modifier

If the attuned used the martial bonus, the damage roll is increased by their Charisma modifier. If they used the histolectual bonus, the damage roll is increased by their Dexterity modifier.
 
><u>Note:</u> The ring does not have the Propulsive property, and the ammunition needed is by default provided by the ring itself.
