_Property_  
These special gloves are made with a special, highly-enchantable fabric, with the capability of holding up to 3 charges, regained in the end of a long rest. When the attuned receives damage from a creature you are aware of within 90' of them, they may invoke one charge to prevent up to 1d6 + your histolecty modifier damage, and the attacker takes sensory damage equal to that amount.
