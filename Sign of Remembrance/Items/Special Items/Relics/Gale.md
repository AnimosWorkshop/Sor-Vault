_This legendary scepter from the end of the First Verse was crafted by Tezik, the Shifter himself, and was later used as the key to his chamber in his main temple in the center of the Bronze Archipelago. It was traditionally kept in the possession of his most trusted follower, before the Sealing occurred, though an earthquake that ensued during it caused the temple to become ruins, trapping the scepter and its wielder inside._
 
As a [[Runecarver#Spell Foci|scepter]], Gale is also a [[Weaponsmith#Simple Melee Weapons|mace]], dealing 1d8 bludgeoning damage and having the Tool (Sorcery) weapon property.
 
_Potency_  
Gale grants the attuned a +3 bonus to their arcana modifier.
 
_Functionality_  
After casting a spell with a casting time of an action, the attuned may use their quick action to attack with Gale as if their action was used on the Attack action.
 
_Property_  
The attuned may use their action in order to execute a booming slash on the ground, forcing all creatures within a 30' cone in front of them to make a Resilience saving throw against your arcana DC, or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and be pushed backward to beyond the cone. They take half damage instead on a success and are not knocked back. This may be used once per long rest before having to recharge. Since the sword was specially made for Tezik's bishops, this bonus is augmented by the attuned's rank in Tezik's hierarchy: A bishop may use this feature up to twice per long rest, while an archbishop may use it up to thrice per long rest.  
This counts as 3rd-Level, Arcana, Tempest for the purpose of magic detection, and for this item's functionality upgrade.
