This special [[Weaponsmith#Martial Melee Weapons|rapier]] was crafted by Tezik, the Shifter, for whomever might be his future archmissionary in the end of the next verse, right before the Sealing occurred. It was later claimed, in the year 1274 of the Second Verse, by Ashe - lead to the Sealed Island in Temuthan to finally be able to talk closely with his god.
 
_Potency_  
While being held by the attuned, Gale provides a +3 bonus to attack rolls with it.
 
_Functionality_  
Flutter uses the wielder's momentum as they strike, dealing 1 additional damage for each 5' moved previously on the current turn since the last attack performed with the weapon.
 
_Property_  
Also while held by the attuned, they may use a quick action to awaken the butterfly-shaped guard, causing it to flutter around them and raising their AC by 1. For the next minute, the next attack hitting the attuned has its damage reduced by 10 as the guard attempts to tank the blow, before the guard returns to its place to allow the attuned to awaken it again. The guard's weakness is bludgeoning damage.  
Flutter's activated AC bonus is augmented if the attuned is in Tezik's hierarchy, raising the AC by 2 for a missionary and by 3 for an archmissionary.
