_Daredevil Relic_
  - Weight: 1 lb
- Magic Type: Histolecty
- Requires Attunement: Potency, Functionality, Property (must have the [[Minor Corruption of the Daredevil|corruption of the daredevil]])
 
The specially cut and highly-enchanted garnet is able to grant the attuned the ability to live off their own speed, while almost entirely relying on it to perpetuate their life.
 
_Potency_  
While attuned to the veil, the attuned's Lucky potency is increased by 1, meaning that when they roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, they can reroll the die and must use the new result. If the attuned already has the Lucky feature from the halfling race or by some other mean, instead they may reroll on either a 1 or a 2 on the d20, and so on.
 
_Functionality_  
While attuned to the garnet, the attuned's hit points maximum is affected by their Dexterity modifier in addition to their regular Constitution and Willpower bonuses. This applies for short rest hit points recovery, too. Due to the major usage of momentum as a part of survival, the attuned requires 2 less death fails in order to die.
 
_Property_  
Once per short rest, the attuned may tap the garnet's power as a major interaction in order to recover 2d8 + Dexterity score hit points. The sheer amount of energy is sufficient not only for the healing, but also for creating a bursting side effect around the user, propelling them in a direction of their choosing up to 30' or until they hit an obstacle.
