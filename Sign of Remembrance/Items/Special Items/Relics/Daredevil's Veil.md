_You don't have to be bold - you can be a hidden beauty, like a butterfly cowering below the treetops to shield itself from the dropping rain. But when that rain is no more, and the sun shines for you - dance. Dance, I tell you! Bloom like a flower in the spring, eager to show your colors to the world; be a sight they won't ever forget. For when that dance is over, none will be left, save for the memories of those you've impressed, and the satisfaction of being none other than yourself._
 
This relatively light veil made out of large metallic scales bears a piece of the ancient Daredevil, making the wearer and the people around them more free, and allow them to feel more without having to fear what the world offers them.
 
_Potency_  
While attuned to the veil, the attuned gains the [[Halfling|Lucky]] feature, meaning that when they roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, they can reroll the die and must use the new result. If the attuned already has this feature from the halfling race or by some other mean, instead they may reroll on either a 1 or a 2 on the d20, and so on.
 
_Functionality_  
While attuned to and wearing the veil, everything becomes more colorful, vivid, and painful. You have a +1 bonus to your Perception modifier, and whenever you deal damage or are dealt damage, add psychic damage to it equal to your Charisma modifier.
 
_Property_  
While attuned to and wearing the veil, the wearer's confidence in themselves is increased, alleviating their tact somewhat to embolden their image, yet drop their will to lie. Nothing should stop one from being, and acting upon, themselves. The attuned adds half their Charisma modifier to their Persuasion modifier, and reduces their Deception modifier by that amount. 
In addition, the attuned may cast the [[Voice of Authority]] spell as a 2nd-level spell from the Veil's internal influence pool up to twice per long rest. When using the Voice of Authority spell while attuned to the veil, the charming curse lasts until the end of your next turn instead of until its start.
