As a [[Weaponsmith#Martial Melee Weapons|shortsword]], Grassblade deals 1d6 piercing damage or 1d6 slashing damage and has the Finesse trait and the Light category.
 
_Potency_  
While being held by the attuned, Gale provides a +3 bonus to attack rolls with it.
 
_Functionality_  
Grassblade is shaped similarly to a kukri, allowing the user to extend a piercing hit with the weapon with a cut. Using a quick action right after the hit allows the user to pull Grassblade violently out of the target's wound, dealing 1d6 slashing damage. This damage is doubled if the original attack critically hit.  
If the user is attuned to Grassblade, they may use the pulling cut as a free action rather than a quick action, either adding to the original damage of the hit or dealing the damage separately.
 
_Property_  
The attuned may use a quick action in order to move in a direction of their choosing up to half their base movement speed. If they are a missionary of Kadaran, they may move up to three-quarters their base movement speed, or their full base movement speed if they are his archmissionary.  
As long as the attuned uses this ability at least once per round, they are able to maintain their flight.
