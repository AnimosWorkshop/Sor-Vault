This recorder was magically modified in order to enable horrific sounds to come out of it naturally according to the user's skill, allowing its bearer to perform both extremely well and extremely terribly.
 
_Functionality_
As an action, the bearer may play the recorder to force a target within 30' that can hear it make a Constitution saving throw. On a fail, the target takes 1d6 sensory damage. If you roll a 1 on this damage roll, it takes 1d4 sensory damage instead.
