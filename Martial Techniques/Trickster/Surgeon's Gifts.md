Crafting concoctions for oneself is one thing, but applying it onto others is something else - allowing you to notice the right spots on which to apply it. Improving a Major Interaction action to administer a concoction to another creature, increase the number of hit points they recover by the amount you would from the Alchemical Affinity feature.
