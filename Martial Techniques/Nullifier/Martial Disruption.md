- Performance Time: 1 attack using the Preemptive Disruption feature
- Success DC: Athletics (Strength), DC 16
- Movement Cost: 5'
 
You perform an attack in a focused way to hinder an enemy's attack while sacrificing some of your own damage. When you perform your Preemptive Disruption feature against a creature making a weapon attack, if you succeed on this technique, you do not deal the 1d6 force damage from the feature, but in turn give them a -2 penalty to their attack and damage rolls for that attack.
