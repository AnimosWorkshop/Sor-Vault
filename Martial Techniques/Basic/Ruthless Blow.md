As you make your attack, you imbue your blow with sheer rage, coming down onto your opponents. The attack deals 2 less damage on a hit, but the creature must move up to 5' away if they are able to, which might trigger attacks of opportunity. On their next turn, their movement is reduced by how much they moved.
