_Basic, Trickster, Extension_
 
- Performance Time: Action
- Success DC: Medicine (Wisdom), DC 10
- Feature Required: Fast Hands (Trickster 3rd)
 
Using improvised tools in the middle of the battlefield, you are able to extend the Medicate quick action into a full action, granting a fallen ally 1 death success instead of advantage on their next death save. If you pass DC 20, you grant 2 death successes instead of just 1.
