The vault contains several sections:
* Sign of Remembrance - the mechanics of the game system
* Temuþen - linguistics concerning the language of the realm of Temuþan
* World Information - lore of the world of Sor, with a focus on the Third Verse (also abbreviated 3V), which is where the current plots occur

While creating characters and playing in the system, I'd also recommend checking out the World Information folder for small details which might enhance the overall experience and immersion in the world.

A changelog for the system and vault is always available in the GitHub web page.

### Learning the System

* The Mechanics folder under the Sign of Remembrance folder contains many pages which explain how to play the game, including a canvas of how to create a character. 
* The primary folders for looking up information concerning the specifics are: Races, Classes and then Magic (for casters) or Martial Techniques (for martials). 
* The Items section contains all the information regarding items, separated to which profession is required to craft them.
* The Build Examples folder is a work in progress, but is planned to have some of the possible build ideas and synergies in order to get a grasp of the system.
