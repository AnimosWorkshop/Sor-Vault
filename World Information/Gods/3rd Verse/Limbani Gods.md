In Limbo, the gods have long used an organized system of communication and policy known as the Limbani Council of Gods, which holds a meeting at certain intervals in order to make sure the interests of all its members are being taken into account for realm policy.

### Halvir

Halvir gained his name as an expert navigator in both Limbo and the other realms, as he lived at a time where gods experimented with creating more stable portals to send small-scale expeditions through the different realms. Originally a follower of [[Gods List#Venandi - God of Curiosity|Venandi]], "You are what you seek" is a common saying of the god. Yet what stands as the passion of Halvir is not the thrill of discovering a new place; it does not have to be a new place. What Halvir seeks is knowing that his talent and craft improve, feeling the thrill of knowing that a planned journey has been successfully completed and that his crew is safe because of him.

This seeking for the right to responsibility has lead him to form a small cross-realm exploration crew by the name of Journeykin, consisting of: [[Fey Gods#Sanae|Sanae]], [[Helian Gods#Ardain|Ardain]] and [[Temuþen Gods#^0b9658|Lakien]]. One of the quests they've gotten was offered by the goddess [[Gods List#Nidora - Goddess of Cooperation|Nidora]], whose husband [[Gods List#Gharil - God of Growth|Gharil]] had been one of the three Temuþen gods to be sealed within the realm's Central Island during the First Cataclysm in order to end it.

Lakien and Halvir prepared the necessary resources for the crew, and in 261 2V, the crew purchased a steady vessel and started their expedition in the realm. After a difficult journey, the crew finally managed to get to the island, which apart from the solar shrine has been almost demolished. In the shrine, they found stairs going deep into the island, and started exploring the depths below.

What the group discovered was relieving yet unsettling: the three gods were alive, but not entirely well, forced to use the majority of their power daily to combat residual magical essence to prolong the stability of not only Temuþan, but the other realms as well through the stable portals connecting them. In essence, all that was left from the First Cataclysm funneled to Central Island, and the gods would not be able to leave until their duty has been fulfilled.

In a desperate move considering their current position, seeing as over two centuries have passed since the Cataclysm, the gods decided to give the crew four successor position, with the promise that in time they will return with other suitable candidates for godhood to take the remaining ones.

As a god, Halvir continues to embody and represent the need to hone one's talents. Despite being one of the oldest gods and especially in the Limbani council of gods, he continues to roam the world, reaching wide and inspiring people across generations.

### Meromia

>Curiosity [[Paragon]] 3rd, [[Druid]] 1st, [[Mentalist]] 1st, [[Metamage]] 5th; [[Minor Blessing of Curiosity]]

A quiet yet decisive woman, Meromia makes for the theory-oriented half of the divine inventor couple, the practical half being her husband [[Hellenise Gods#Polerk|Polerk]]. A master of both the sorcerous and material arts, meromia weaves action into the inanimate, and urges other brilliant minds to do the same.

### Valeo

### Ollial

Having been chosen in the 12th century 2V, Ollial is a relatively young god, but one who has accumulated much positive reputation in his preparation for the Second Cataclysm as a [[Soran Theology#Nomination Reasoning|deeds-chosen god]]. Assuming that when the time comes, people would prefer protecting their own in-life home instead of the realm they got to upon unliving, Ollial worried for the well-being and protection of the realm, and began recruiting as many people as he could for the cause, rallying the undead and forming Dahrial's Sovereign, a body serving as its self-regulating and protecting organization living mostly outside of only preparing the newly-unborn for recovery handled by the Dahrian gods. This earned Ollial the moniker 'the Reaper', as he was known for gathering undead and guiding them to a new life in Dahrial.

Despite this, in the Third Verse Ollial spends most of his time in Limbo, where he can participate in the Limbani council of gods as it became tradition during the Second Verse, when he was still a successor, and Dahrial's Sovereign is now truly self-sufficient and is run by the local undead.

Some view Ollial's domain as involving but not limited to protection, similar to the old Fahren belief, but guided by compromise instead of pure conviction.
