Appears to be a tall, quiet woman who often bears a deadpan expression, considering the world around her in an almost theoretical manner. She is a firm believer that knowledge should be amassed and distributed to everyone, and that choice must be allowed to be taken freely yet as informed as possible, without consideration of any specific policy. While people do make mistakes while acting, those tend to even out across a large scale, and the best course of action is taken as the mean value of these actions.
