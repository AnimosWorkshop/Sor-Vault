Appears to be a tall, quiet woman who often bears a deadpan expression, considering the world around her in an almost theoretical manner. She is a firm believer that knowledge should be amassed and distributed to everyone, and that choice must be allowed to be taken freely yet as informed as possible, without consideration of any specific policy. While people do make mistakes while acting, those tend to even out across a large scale, and the best course of action is taken as the mean value of these actions.

### Renatke

>[[Zirval#Beckoned Zirval|Beckoned]] [[Zirval]]; Protection [[Druid]] 10th

Renatke is of the firm belief that nature provides for those who are willing to provide for nature. She looks at the wondrous world of Preida, with the world itself adapting to each race inhabiting it; and to [[TemuÃ¾an]], with the climate adapting to the preference of each elder dragon. It is undeniable for her that remains of the ancient Architects, gods of the First Verse, are still present in the worlds they created and in the will of nature.
