### Sipya

Throughout the years, Dafonae, Saenka's eldest daughter, never managed to redefine her home in an earnest way. Feeling as if she was betrayed by fate itself to bring her into a life of reluctant duty, she eventually found comfort within a friend she made along the way, a seeker satyr by the name of Sipya. 

Although throughout the years Sipya served as Dafonae's confidant and voice, in truth those who got closer managed to see the truth. While truly channeling Dafonae's ideals, it was Sipya who participated in the gatherings of Saenka's children and blessing the temples, while Dafonae achieved what she sought in freedom, and ability to travel unnoticed and see the world for what it truly was in order for the two to decide what it was that constituted the world's lifeline and direction of continuity. 

For her utmost devotion and friendship, Sipya was named the Echo of Life, who had managed to help Dafonae blossom within death, and was rewarded with successorship and godhood.
