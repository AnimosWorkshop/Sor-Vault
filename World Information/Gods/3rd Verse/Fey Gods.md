### Sipya

>[[Satyr#Seeker Satyr|Seeker]] [[Satyr]]

Throughout the years, Dafonae, Saenka's eldest daughter, never managed to redefine her home in an earnest way. Feeling as if she was betrayed by fate itself to bring her into a life of reluctant duty, she eventually found comfort within a friend she made along the way.

Although throughout the years Sipya served as Dafonae's confidant and voice, in truth those who got closer managed to see the truth. While truly channeling Dafonae's ideals, it was Sipya who participated in the gatherings of Saenka's children and blessing the temples, while Dafonae achieved what she sought in freedom, and ability to travel unnoticed and see the world for what it truly was in order for the two to decide what it was that constituted the world's lifeline and direction of continuity. 

For her utmost devotion and friendship, Sipya was named the Echo of Life, who had managed to help Dafonae blossom within death, and was rewarded with successorship and godhood.

### Kitas Harlyr

>[[Satyr#Song Satyr|Song]] [[Satyr]]

Growing up in a family who could in principle provide for anything he could wish for, Kitas was constantly reminded by his mother that it is not birthright that grants an heir their claim; nor it is their talent, nor knowledge, but as a matter of fact, only the lord and lady of the house themselves. If they wished to, everything could go up in flame when the time came. 

Today, there are those who claim that Kitas never cared for such things, that he was so pure of heart he could not be threatened by such cruel and empty claims. They are, to their dismay, wrong. Kitas cared very much, and it was this concern and anger that eventually got him to dangerous levels of stress. And, only as he was lying on the hospital bed, he go to a state beyond fear: apathy.

The young Harlyr lad, still in his 20s, ceased trying to impress his parents, discontinued his study of the family business of instrument crafting, and left his home in search for a goal as a clean slate. He started working as a janitor in the same hospital he lay in, while trying to absorb as much knowledge he could from his surroundings. Every medical book he could lay his hands on, every bit about magic and the world around him, whatever he managed to process. 

Kitas had only one problem: he had no natural knack for the sciences. He could understand general concepts, and could talk about them with excitement, but never managed to process the deeper ends of the cutting edge. The best knowledge he managed to attain during his stay there was stories: life experiences from events he never got to, from people of different views and perspectives on the world. And indeed, it was the personal part that made these stick for him, beyond any objective fact of matter.

As time went on, Kitas became versed in the histolectual spirit, taking these stories and spinning them anew: be it as analogues, anecdotes and contradictions, putting a new light for the patients. Some people even started returning to the hospital, not for physical injuries, but simply to talk with the man who helped ease their tension during a time of pain. What was certain, at a point, was that Kitas managed to outgrow his old family name, and created a new path for himself to walk on, laying the road for others to walk in as well. 

He pressed with faith, following the steps of [[Gods List#Aria - Goddess of Knowledge|Aria]] all the way to the city of [[Hell#Frozen Hell|Jarkabli]], where he continued dedicating his life and energy to refining the art of forming bonds, histolectual or otherwise, with others.
