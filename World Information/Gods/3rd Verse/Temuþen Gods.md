Until only several dozen years before the Second Cataclysm, the Temuþen gods used to meet with each other rather rarely unless any major event had happened. However, they since created Temuþan's Divine Alliance (TDA), a great organization hosting many other important institutions in the realm. However, the Great Dragon War and the betrayal of Creod caused it to take care now of only half of the world - Carniules, while Gandecrala's only divine protection is given by the betrayer god of oaths.

## Carniules

### Vilidin

Vilidin came to the Bronze Archipelago from the Black Dragonland after the Great Dragon War began. She was betrayed by her country's dragonflight, who felt resentment during these past centuries after Vilidin led a socialist revolution in it, which was what made her rise as a candidate for godhood in the first place. Now, she manages the [[Bronze Welfare Service]] organization alongside Ratoki in hope to bring the community of the free world together.

### Niala

Back in the 9th century 2V, Niala was a soldier in the Red Dragonlands, and both her deeds and writings focusing on the importance of the will to life has elevated her in the ranks of the late Gweldyn and led to her ascension.

Ever since the Great Dragon War started, Niala and her forces put a lot of effort on their northern border in order to put effort and draw as many soldiers from the enemy's side to defend it, in order to relieve the other borders as the strongest single army in Carniules. In order to make sure of this, the Redpoint government gave out incentives for soldiers of all ranks financial incentives to join the cause in the war, which led to a massive wave of conscription.
While good in its own right, this left the home front severely undermanned, lacking the ability to support the front lines without compromising those who stay behind. ^b55568

Niala herself is the primary god actually fighting the war against Gandecrala, as she has the most combat experience and is considered to be a legendary general in Temuthan and the history of the world. Therefore, she has less time to manage the problems created by transferring so many people to the front lines, other than supporting foundational work to populate the borders so that warriors will be able to bring their families close and maintain morale, which created many ghost villages across the country.
