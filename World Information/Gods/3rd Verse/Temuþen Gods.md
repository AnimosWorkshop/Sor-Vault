Until only several dozen years before the Second Cataclysm, the Temuþen gods used to meet with each other rather rarely unless any major event had happened. However, they since created Temuþan's Divine Alliance (TDA), a great organization hosting many other important institutions in the realm. However, the Great Dragon War and the betrayal of Creno caused it to take care now of only half of the world - Carniules, while Gandecrala's only divine protection is given by the betrayer god of oaths.

## Carniules

### Ratoki

>[[Halfling#Strongheart Halfling|Strongheart]] [[Halfling]]; [[Blessing of Leadership]]

The oldest living Temuþen god, Ratoki was orphaned from both of her parents at an early age due to the Brass-Blue war of 431 2V. Due to her situation, she was sent to a war orphanage, where a brass dragon by the name of Janalieþ eventually took her as her kid. This was an unusual state of affairs for a non-dragon child, who was exposed to high draconic society and culture at a time when the dragonland was very clearly hierarchical, and after a tough war which made the dragons only clutch more onto their power.

Janalieþ herself was of moderate status, and acknowledging Ratoki as her legal daughter came with some risk to that status, despite her own parents' support for her. However, she intended to keep this difficulty out of Ratoki's sight. This made the child's growth into adolescence conflicted: she was a 'daughter of giants', so to speak, making her high ranking but very different among her peers while not allowing her to fully integrate into the society she was growing in.

As Ratoki came of age, she was introduced to draconic society, which came with its own set of challenges. Some were fascinated by her, some revolted, but it seemed that everyone had some opinion about the daughter of giants; everyone except for the innocent daughter of giants. Confiding with her mother, the seemingly best course of action was to become informed, and become a character worth the interest.

By the time Ratoki was 23 years old, she managed to accumulate a fair share of friends and foes in the Brass society. She presented herself as calm yet inquisitive, matching her own piece into the political puzzle, and making it possible for her non-dragon peers to match their own into the mesh as well. They were closer to the larger portion of the population, which had its own power, as they often sought to remind others.

Ratoki did not wish to destroy the power structure of the Brass Dragonland, nor did she wish to take the dragonflight out of power. Though it might not be obvious to the people of late-2V countries, and to Carniumeu citizens of 3V, at the time non-dragons did not only have less opportunities than dragons, but they were being trialed differently as well. Ratoki simply demanded the social attitude toward all Brass citizens to be equal. With her goals starting to be met in the Brass Dragonland, she started traveling the world as well, presenting her ideas to people across Temuþan, which slowly started the Temuþen revolutions of the 5th century 2V, becoming the basis for the social system of many of the Dragonlands. For this, Ratoki was offered successorship by [[Helian Gods#Ardain|Ardain]], who escorted her to Central Island to meet [[Gods List#Raganda - Goddess of Equality|Raganda]] in person.

### Vilidin

>[[Dwarf#Dune Dwarf|Dune]] [[Dwarf]]

Vilidin was born in the northern regions of Estrana, in the Black dragon of the 6th century 2V. At the time, the dragonland has evolved beyond the revolutions, and had begun incorporating non-dragon citizens into specialty roles in its army. More than any other country, the Black Dragonland had always considered its natural imitation ability and roaming nature to be its edge over other dragonlands, leading to it becoming an intelligence superpower in the realm. Locked in a war with its southern neighbors in the [[World Information/Realms/Temuþen Countries/Akelfutes|Red Dragonland]], the country chose to make the war effort possible by forcing their enemy to spend more than them on the conflict.

At first, the lass came into the picture as a promising candidate for an intelligence role, but as she considered the role more and more seriously, she looked around at the country she was supposed to focus on less during her service: her home. She noticed how investing so many resources into foreign intelligence often leaves one blind to the troubles at home, which only grew as the main source of social mobility for non-dragons of low status was to join the army for those exact positions.

Vilidin pushed her dragonland to recognize this problem, and move toward a more socialist world view, developing the country's systems without forsaking community. She became invested in [[Gods List#Nidora - Goddess of Cooperation|Nidorian]] worship, and was eventually recognized for her faith and deeds in the form of successorship.

After the Great Dragon War began, Vilidin fled her overtaken home to the [[Bronze Archipelago|Bronze Archipelago]]. She was betrayed by her country's dragonflight, which felt that the revolution she led came to undermine dragon kind. Now, she manages the [[Bronze Welfare Service]] organization alongside [[#Ratoki]] in hope to bring the community of the free world together and manage the many refugees of the war.

### Niala

>[[Orc#Berserker Orc|Berserker]] [[Orc]]; Hurler [[Fighter]] 3rd, [[Partisan]] 7th

Back in the 9th century 2V, Niala was a soldier in the Red Dragonland, and both her deeds and writings focusing on the importance of the will to life has elevated her in the ranks of the late [[Gods List#Gweldyn - God of Freedom|Gweldyn]] and led to her ascension. She is a self-proclaimed active advocate of life, and a firm believer that before one considers cognitive and emotional freedom, they must strive to physical freedom, expressed by the ability to live and survive. 

During the 2V, her views alongside her [[World Information/Realms/Temuþen Countries/Akelfutes|country of origin]] seemed militaristic to foreigners; however, after the Cataclysm, she has garnered much following, due to how the conception of a guaranteed life was shattered.

Ever since the Great Dragon War started, Niala and her forces put a lot of effort on their northern border in order to draw as many soldiers from the enemy's side to defend it, for the purpose of relieving the other borders as the strongest single army in Carniules. To ensure this, the Akelfutes government gave out financial incentives for soldiers of all ranks to join the cause in the war, which led to a massive wave of conscription.
While good in its own right, this left the home front severely undermanned, lacking the ability to support the front lines without compromising those who stay behind. ^b55568

Niala herself is the primary god actually fighting the war against Gandecrala, as she has the most combat experience and is considered to be a legendary general in Temuþan and the history of the world. Therefore, she has less time to manage the problems created by transferring so many people to the front lines, other than supporting foundational work to populate the borders so that warriors will be able to bring their families close and maintain morale, which created many ghost villages across the country.

### Lirika

>[[Human#Gifted Human|Gifted]] [[Human]] (Intelligence); [[Blessing of the Bard]]

A rather mysterious god who has gone all the more into the shadows ever since the Second Cataclysm, Lirika used to be an important figure of the bygone Silver Dragonland, with the earliest mentions of her in the year 958 2V. Her rising to power remains a question for the history books, yet it is said within [[Gods List#Aria - Goddess of Knowledge|Arian]] circles that Lirika possesses a unique, almost unorthodox manner of research, being able to delve so deep into a topic as if she has experienced it herself.

In 1271 2V, Lirika attempted her most dangerous and fatal gambit yet, attempting to kidnap the heir of the Puppeteer clan, [[#Alieca Roid]] from her mother, which set off a war whose consequences only truly ended with the demise of the Silver Dragonland in the year 21 3V. Lirika has not been accepted as a full citizen of any country in Temuþan, aside from [[World Information/Realms/Temuþen Countries/Breniskal]], where she can stay but not take any political role, as her people were annexed into it.

### Þea of Maþak

>[[Cubare#Protector Cubare|Protector]] [[Cubare]]; Leadership [[Paragon]] 2nd, [[Trickster]] 3rd, [[Nullifier]] 5th

Þea used to be a political activist in her home of the Blue Dragonland, leading a group called Devouts of the Sands. However, she attracted the hostile attention of Nil Latuo, god-king of the Blue Dragonland and the previous archbishop of [[Gods List#Hastur - God of Leadership|Hastur]]. After many years of persecution and against the Devouts and countless public executions, Þea and her peers decided that enough was enough. She utilized the help of Loznia, a devoted worshipper of [[Limbani Gods#Datson|Datson]] and back then a leader of a secret rebellion group in the country, to play a trick on Nil, and lure his soldiers out of the fortress where the god was staying. That night, Þea snuck in and used her full ability as a talented nullifier to counteract Neil's magic and kill him.

This act has been the first of its kind, as no mortal had ever killed a god prior to this point. This proved that the act was possible, and a danger to the position of the gods. However, the Limbani council of gods decided to elevate Þea instead of punishing her, recognizing both her case against Nil, and the national case against one god putting an entire dragonland under his thumb.

Þea herself acts very differently to Nil in her position, and her first act was to appoint local leaders from throughout her country to rule over the people, whereas she only served as an ideological beacon. This worked well and earned her the favor of the northern half of the country, whereas the southern half remained loyal to Nil's spiritual successor, until the south's uprising by Loznia in the year 1276 2V, which brought peace to the dragonland right until the Great Dragon War.

The new war forced Þea and her people flee en masse to [[Avsekoper]], the country of her [[#Meralien (Meralyn) Martor|husband]], where she keeps her ideology and takes care of both her people and the greater geopolitical entity of Carniules.

### Meralien (Meralyn) Martor

>[[Vident#Inquisitive Vident|Inquisitive]] [[Vident]]; Secrecy [[Paragon]] 2nd, [[Trickster]] 3rd, [[Nullifier]] 5th

Born to the Martor family of the [[Urevneþ|Puppeteers]], Meralien left his original home in the territory of the Black Dragonland in the continent of Estrana, and moved with his brother to [[Avsekoper|Copperland]], where he constructed a temple to [[Gods List#Kadaran - God of Secrecy|Kadaran]]. With a deep belief in the Kadarani way, young Meralien decided to act upon his belief that knowledge about the School of Puppetry should not be exclusive to a people by blood relation, but by their love for sorcery. He used his period in the [[Limbani Gods#Jektel|nullifier school]] in [[Limbo]] to leak these [[spell scrolls]] where no Puppeteer would think to check. This knowledge eventually came to [[#Lirika]] in her travels, which happily approved of the move.

After his training, for a period of a few years Meralien made many trips throughout the realms, especially [[Temuþan]], [[Limbo]] and [[Dahrial]], to aid both his wife [[#Þea of Maþak|Þea]], his friend at the time [[Limbani Gods#Ollial|Ollial]], and his mentor Keuldor, who had been at the time Kadaran's archmissionary for over a century. After several years, Meralien had secured his position as Keuldor's most loyal follower, her right-hand man and her confidant. After her husband died, Keuldor struggled coping with the thought of having to deal with her loss for so many years, as ascending in 3V would mean living another whole milenium. Realising Meralien's unique position and knowledge, Keuldor decided to pass the successorship to him in the year 1250 2V.

Meralien's position and relationship with many of the gods of Temuþan and beyond made him rather famous, despite being the god of secrecy. He leads his people with a simple style of charisma, and more than any other successor of Kadaran, keeps the spirit that one should act kindly to anyone they meet, as they might never know whether that person was actually a god.

### Ac Farnor

Ac grew to become the second heir of the noble Farnor family in the [[World Information/Realms/Temuþen Countries/Breniskal|Green Dragonland]]. However, dissatisfied with the way his father was handling the family business, and by extension the influence of his family over society, he fled home at an early age and decided that whatever growth and influence he'd gather would be on his own terms.

In 1274 2V, when [[Fey Gods#Sanae|Sanae]] came to Temuþan after years of solitude in search for an archmissionary for [[Gods List#Tezik - God of Change|Tezik]], she came into Ac as he and his peers have found a sealed cave in northern Loþano. The explorers managed to recover [[Gale]] from the cave, which used to be Tezik's oldest temple, and Ac declared his servitude to the god after his findings.

As a god, Ac believes that the focus of change should be for the weak, the downtrodden who often don't find it possible to look beyond their current reality and even dream of a better future. He is a driving force behind TDA's welfare service, while keeping his place as a figure in [[World Information/Realms/Temuþen Countries/Breniskal]] despite his choosing being very close toward the end of 2V, a planner who thinks best for the short term; a self-contradictory man which believes in and does what's best for his people.

### Alieca Roid

>[[Fariste#Scholar Fariste|Scholar]] [[Fariste]]; Puppetry [[Wizard]] 10th; [[Major Blessing of Curiosity]], [[Blessing of Leadership]]

The direct firstborn descendent of the inventor of the School of Puppetry Marga Roid, Alieca now leads her [[Urevneþ|people]] with great strength. In the year 1271 2V, while her mother was still the head of the family, Alieca was kidnapped by a group led by [[#Lirika]] from her home in the Silver Dragonland, in the hopes of being able to leverage the Puppeteers into giving her the power sealed within the Roid vault. Her mother, bearing the responsibility of generations past and generations to come, responded by war, during which she was killed a year after.

Alieca managed to flee her captors as they were trying to smuggle her through [[Avsekoper|Copperland]], and hid in the last place where they'd try to find her: the Copperland army. Since Puppeteers refused to join the army, from the will not to face their brethren on the battlefield, she managed to dodge Lirika's eye, as the then-successor was instead focused on quieting rumors about the war and the kidnapping to maintain the appearance of the dragonland as a peaceful nation.

After serving more than the mandatory period in the Copperland army and becoming an officer to adapt a more advanced tactical skill and leadership, she coordinated with [[#Meralien (Meralyn) Martor|Meralien Martor]], a successor at the time and a denounced Puppeteer, to ensure her safe passage from the country to the realm of [[Heliax]]. There, she earned the trust of the goddess Nidora, and pleaded her to aid in gaining the favor of [[Gods List#Gharil - God of Confidence|Gharil]], a Temuþen god who was sealed within Central Island for the whole of 2V.

After spending years in learning and serving under [[Gods List#Nidora - Goddess of Collectivity|Nidora]], the goddess confided her that Lakien, Gharil's archangel for over a millenium at that point, proved with time to be primarily a man of words, after having the bulk of his contribution during the first century of his appointment, and expressed her worries for Temuþan if the successors would ever look up to him for guidance. She appreciated Alieca's ambition and will to grow and learn, and knew that she was much more than her impressive family tree.  ^0b9658

With Nidora's metaphorical blessing, Alieca traveled to Central Island and argued her case to Gharil, only a year before the Second Cataclysm. Furious to have been blinded by Lakien due to his inability to know what was happening in the world outside Central Island, and trusting the judgement of his wife, Gharil decided to revoke the successorship of Lakien and grant it instead to Alieca.

More than any of Gharil's other successors, Alieca embodies best what Gharil wished to represent as a god: an force which refuses to die, and demands to grow through all soil, around every obstacle which might come in their way.

## Gandecrala

#### Creno

>[[Orc#Nomad Orc|Nomad]] [[Orc]]

Creno became a very controversial figure in Temuþan after his choice to side with Gandecrala in their adversity against the TDA. While many were swift to criticize him and turn to other successors of Alsidia for guidance, some supporters of his claim that he decided to show his people the loyalty they deserve until the bitter end - he is the one to represent the Temuþen people in the new world order in Gandecrala, and he shall not forsake them even when he would not agree fully with his country's leaders. 

No matter on which side you're on, you still deserve to have a god to look up to within your home; a privilege the Temuþen people of 2V did not have.
