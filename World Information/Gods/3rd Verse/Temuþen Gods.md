Until only several dozen years before the Second Cataclysm, the Temuþen gods used to meet with each other rather rarely unless any major event had happened. However, they since created Temuþan's Divine Alliance (TDA), a great organization hosting many other important institutions in the realm. However, the Great Dragon War and the betrayal of Creno caused it to take care now of only half of the world - Carniules, while Gandecrala's only divine protection is given by the betrayer god of oaths.

## Carniules

### Vilidin

Vilidin came to the Bronze Archipelago from the Black Dragonland after the Great Dragon War began. She was betrayed by her country's dragonflight, who felt resentment during these past centuries after Vilidin led a socialist revolution in it, which was what made her rise as a candidate for godhood in the first place. Now, she manages the [[Bronze Welfare Service]] organization alongside Ratoki in hope to bring the community of the free world together.
### Ratoki

### Ashe Faranor
### Lirika

### Alicia Royd

>[[Fariste#Scholar Fariste|Scholar]] [[Fariste]]; Puppeteering [[Wizard]] 10th; [[Major Blessing of Curiosity]]

### Meralien (Meralyn) Martor
### Þea of Maþak

### Niala

>[[Orc#Berserker Orc|Berserker]] [[Orc]]; Hurler [[Fighter]] 3rd, [[Partisan]] 7th

Back in the 9th century 2V, Niala was a soldier in the Red Dragonlands, and both her deeds and writings focusing on the importance of the will to life has elevated her in the ranks of the late Gweldyn and led to her ascension. She is a self-proclaimed active advocate of life, and a firm believer that before one considers cognitive and emotional freedom, they must strive is physical freedom, expressed by the ability to live and survive. 

During the 2V, her views alongside her country of origin seemed militaristic to foreigners; however, after the Cataclysm, she has garnered much following, due to how the conception of a guaranteed life was shattered.

Ever since the Great Dragon War started, Niala and her forces put a lot of effort on their northern border in order to put effort and draw as many soldiers from the enemy's side to defend it, in order to relieve the other borders as the strongest single army in Carniules. In order to make sure of this, the Redpoint government gave out incentives for soldiers of all ranks financial incentives to join the cause in the war, which led to a massive wave of conscription.
While good in its own right, this left the home front severely undermanned, lacking the ability to support the front lines without compromising those who stay behind. ^b55568

Niala herself is the primary god actually fighting the war against Gandecrala, as she has the most combat experience and is considered to be a legendary general in Temuthan and the history of the world. Therefore, she has less time to manage the problems created by transferring so many people to the front lines, other than supporting foundational work to populate the borders so that warriors will be able to bring their families close and maintain morale, which created many ghost villages across the country.

## Gandecrala

#### Creno

>[[Orc#Nomad Orc|Nomad]] [[Orc]]

Creno became a very controversial figure in Temuþan after his choice to side with Gandecrala in their adversity against the TDA. While many were swift to criticize him and turn to other successors of Alsidia for guidance, some supporters of his claim that he decided to show his people the loyalty they deserve until the bitter end - he is the one to represent the Temuþen people in the new world order in Gandecrala, and he shall not forsake them even when he would not agree fully with his country's leaders. 

No matter on which side you're on, you still deserve to have a god to look up to within your home; a privilege the Temuþen people of 2V did not have.
