## Becoming in the 3rd Verse

Throughout 2V, the Green Dragonland has operated with a clear hierarchy: the Flight's Council as the ruling body, with a strong police force to ensure the people's feeling of safety, and the elite force of the Dragon's Claw, said to be able to pluck the unwanted individuals out of the innocent population. The message was clear: a good citizen will be met with wellness and security, while a bad citizen will be met with nothing but justice.

This model has worked well, and caused the Green Dragonland to be a respected superpower. Instead of pursuing war, the dragonland used its reputation to hold trade relations with the [[Bronze Archipelago|Bronze Dragonland]] for a powerful alliance.

When the [[Urevneþ]]-Silver war began at the start of 3V, the dragonland was faced with a choice: either support its territorial neighbor dragonland, whose economy and army were struggling due to poor policy choices throughout the end of 2V; or support the newly established Urevneþ, some of whose citizens used to be contributing members of the Green Dragonland's society prior to the country's conception. As a powerful country, the dragonland had the power to more than tip the scales, and the Council decision echoed throughout history.

In the year 22 3V, the Green Dragonland annexed the areas remaining of the defeated Silver Dragonland in exchange for peace and cooperation with the now fully sovereign [[Urevneþ]] to its south. This was not a quiet integration into society, but a forced social change upon the _silviumeu_, affecting everyone even up to the silver [[Dragon|elder dragon]] and the newly-ascended goddess [[Temuþen Gods#Lirika|Lirika]].
The country changed its name to Breniskal - "Arborwall", which only further solidified how the country was going to retain its old values, of protecting its people and rooting out anyone who threatens the peace, as dedicated to the late god Fahren and his archangel successor, [[Helian Gods#Ethalia|Ethalia]].

### Structure and Rule

Breniskal is unique in that it preserved its eldress dragon, currently Dimresa, as head of the national council and ruler of Breniskal. 
The council itself is made up of both dragons and non-dragons, with each region having three seats. The remaining five seats are reserved to the eldress and the Claw: her four most trusted companions, each taking the title of a Talon. Within the walls of the court, all must [[Dragon#Chromatic|assume forms]] of small or medium creatures, except for the eldress who assumes a large non-dragon form. This is so all will talk within the walls as equals.
The Claw's members show at the council covered; and since they are not chosen by the people but by the eldress, their true appearance, or even whether they are dragons or not, is unknown to the public.

For each region, including the capital of Zdarbel, there is a regional council. Though it is decided by the people of the region, the Claw may veto and persecute the candidates if they see fit, though the event is rare.

## Regions
### Gezrier

An island located in the sea east from the country toward Central Island. Despite its size, the island holds a great meaning in the dynamics of the whole of Temuþan, as in it lies the great portal to Preida. As such, Gezrier enjoys traffic of both Breniumeu citizens, Fey visitors, divine messengers and so on.
The island also houses the Tree of Survival, _Bren-Lazxenier_, which spreads its roots deep and wide into Sor. ^e4904a
