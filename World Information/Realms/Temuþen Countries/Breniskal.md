## Becoming in the 3rd Verse

In the year 22 3V, the strong and stable Green Dragonland annexed the areas remaining of the defeated Silver Dragonlands in the Urevneþ-Silver war in exchange for peace with the now fully sovereign [[Urevneþ]] to its south. This was not a quiet integration into society, but instead a forced social change upon the _silviumeu_, even up to the Silver [[Dragon|elder]] and the newly-ascended goddess [[Temuþen Gods#Lirika|Lirika]].

The country changed its name to Breniskal - "Arborwall", which only further solidified how the country was going to retain its old values, of protecting its people and rooting out anyone who threatens the peace, as dedicated to the late god Fahren and his archangel successor, [[Helian Gods#Ethalia|Ethalia]];

## Regions
### Gezrier

An island located in the sea east from the country toward Central Island. Despite its size, the island holds a great meaning in the dynamics of the whole of Temuþan, as in it lies the great portal to Preida. As such, Gezrier enjoys traffic of both Breniumeu citizens, Fey visitors, divine messengers and so on.
The island also houses the Tree of Survival, _Bren-Lazxenier_, which spreads its roots deep and wide into Sor.
