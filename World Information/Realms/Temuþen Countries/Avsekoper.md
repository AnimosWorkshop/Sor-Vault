## Becoming in the 3rd Verse

During the Great Dragon War, Anapati refugees fled from the Blue Federation to Copperland and aided in the war effort. As people of two countries who knew conflict and survived the Cataclysm, cooperation came naturally with the aid of [[Temuþen Gods#Meralien (Meralyn) Martor|Meralien Martor]] and [[Temuþen Gods#Þea of Maþak|Þea of Maþaq]], two new gods who now maintain peace in the country, which chose to take on a new name to mark an end to the age of the dragonlands, called Avsekoper - "Copperoot".

The people native to Avsekoper are often called koperium (“coppern”), and the refugees are called federationists, or bifium federationists. Among them, there is a fairly large group who consider themselves to be coppern at heart, due to the changes in the world and a newfound love for their new home. Those are sometimes called bifedaxium (“old blues”), and they wish to have rights equal to the koperium.

## Regions

### Iarla

The capital region of Avsekoper, which also houses its capital city. Iarla is in the northwestern border of Avsekoper's central lake, and enjoys the safety given to it by the Adfier plateau.

### Adfier

A region named after the great plateau it is atop of, watching over Iarla in its northeastern border. Adfier is globally important for several reasons, one of which being the TDA headquarters which reside in a town in the suburbs of the city of Adfier proper. The region of Adfier used to have a large population dedicated to following Aria, the Scholar. According to the disappointment in the Great Dragon War and the koperium interest of cooperating with [[Urevneþ]], eventually that faith shifted over to [[Helian Gods|Kitas]]. ^afab9d
