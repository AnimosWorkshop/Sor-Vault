## Becoming in the 3rd Verse

Not long after the new elder dragon Erlikan was chosen, in the year 1323 2V, most of the royal families decided to launch a revolution against the ruling order at the time, which was a traditional dictatorship by the late elder dragon. Realizing the severe tear in the people he was supposed to lead, the new elder decided to disappear from the surface, turning instead to pull the strings of the country from the shadows. 

Through his trusted followers, Erlikan managed to fan the flames of passion in the people of the Copper Dragonland, encouraging them to demand a full democracy instead of being ruled by the rebellious aristocracy. Thus, the country became known as Copperland, and though it took some years to balance the scales, for once in Temuþan dragons and non-dragons were truly equal in the young country.

A devout follower of Kadaran himself, toward the end of 2V Erlikan reached to Kadaran's successor from Copperland, [[Temuþen Gods#Meralien (Meralyn) Martor|Meralien Martor]], and asked him to prepare the country to expect his return when the time comes at the Second Cataclysm. And indeed, as it started, Erlikan rose from underground and led the armies of Copperland himself from the front lines, both against against the elementals and against Gandecrala when the Great Dragon War started.

During the war, refugees from the continent of Anapat, and specifically the Blue Federation, fled to Copperland as coordinated between [[Temuþen Gods#Meralien (Meralyn) Martor|Meralien]] and [[Temuþen Gods#Þea of Maþak|Þea of Maþak]], and aided in the war effort. As two people of countries who knew conflict and now survived the Cataclysm, it was decided in Copperland to integrate the refugees into the country. At the year 18 3V, Copperland decided to symbolize the resistance against Gandecrala and the end of dragonalnds by changing its name to Avsekoper - "Copperoot".

Though the people of the country are often called _avsiumeu_, there is sometimes further separation between calling people by their country of origin. The people native to Avsekoper are often called _koperiumeu_ (“coppern”), and the refugees are called federationists, or _bifiumeu_ federationists. Among them, there is a fairly large group who consider themselves to be coppern at heart, due to the changes in the world and a newfound love for their new home. Those are sometimes called _bifedaxiumeu_ (“old blues”).

## Regions

### Iarla

The capital region of Avsekoper, which also houses its capital city. Iarla is in the northwestern border of Avsekoper's central lake, and enjoys the safety given to it by the Adfier plateau.

### Adfier

A region named after the great plateau it is atop of, watching over Iarla in its northeastern border. Adfier is globally important for several reasons, one of which being the TDA headquarters which reside in a town in the suburbs of the city of Adfier proper. The region of Adfier used to have a large population dedicated to following Aria, the Scholar. According to the disappointment in the Great Dragon War and the koperium interest of cooperating with [[Urevneþ]], eventually that faith shifted over to [[Helian Gods|Kitas]]. ^afab9d
