## Becoming in the 3rd Verse

In 2V, the Red Dragonland was known to be a strong warring nation, with its prowess stemming from a strong national incentive for technological innovation, directed from the shadows by successor at the time, [[Temuþen Gods#Niala|Niala]]. As the Second Cataclysm drew near, Niala appeared more publicly as a head figure in the Dragonland, in her call to join Temuþan's Divine Alliance, a realm-wide organization to ensure the preparation toward the Cataclysm.

The country's rule is traditionally meritocratic, with a combination of ambition and ability being able to land one a good position in many of the nation-funded industrial complexes, research facilities, and of course the military. With no regard to race, non-dragons stand shoulder to shoulder with dragon peers to make the homeland proud.

In the year 18 3V, the dragonland changed its name to Akelfutes (Redpoint) in a move coordinated with the newly renamed [[Avsekoper]], to distance themselves from [[Gandecrala]], and its dragon-focused power structure.
