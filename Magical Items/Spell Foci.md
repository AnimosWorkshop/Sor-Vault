As mentioned in the magic section, casting spells requires a verbal component given by speech, and a somatic component provided either with a free hand or a spell focus. Spell foci are intriguing objects, used mostly by mages in order to enhance the way they use or react to magic of a specific magic type. Each focus has a specific magic type it is associated with, and the focus may only assist to cast spells of that type. Any features and upgrades which enhance the use of the magic using the item only apply to that magic type. Note that in order to activate a functionality or property upgrade the focus has, it must be held by the attuned, and the attuned may only benefit from one focus at a time of each magic type. The three types of foci are:
 
| **Item** | **Cost** | **Weight** | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
