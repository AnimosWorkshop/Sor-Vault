This tome, covered with tanned leather dyed dark purple and grayish black, has a writing on it in Peralian - "Tome of Mortality". Its content details the rising and falling of ordinary people, glorious empires and legends - not specifically, but in a general tone. None can escape death, not even those who claim to be able to resist the dreaded thing. It may also serve as a histolectual spellcasting focus.
 
_Potency_  
A creature attuned to the tome gets a +1 bonus to their histolecty modifier.
 
_Functionality_  
The attuned may use the tome as an action to force a creature they can see within 30' to make an Initiative saving throw, taking 2d6 necrotic damage on a fail. This counts as 1st-level, histolecty, decay for the purpose of magic detection.
 
_Property_  
The book has 3 charges, and it regains 1 at dusk if left under the open sky. Anyone can open the book, and read a short poem from the prologue as an action, which translates in Common to:  
_"All things must die,_  
_everything passes away;_  
_To death, no one can lie,_  
_And none can keep it at bay."_  
After the poem is recited, all creatures within 30' must succeed on a Wits saving throw. Any creature who fails the save loses resistance 1 to necrotic damage, and becomes vulnerable to necrotic damage if they didn't have resistance to it beforehand, in addition to having the [decaying](Conditions.md) condition. These effects last for 10 mintues.
