- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60' cone
- Duration: Instantaneous  

You unleash a burst of magic to knock away all unattended small objects and held objects within range, towards beyond the range of the cone. A creature holding items within range must make an Initiative saving throw or have them be knocked away from their hands. All objects affected this way fall just beyond the cone's border.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The cone's range increases by 15' for each spell level above 4th.
