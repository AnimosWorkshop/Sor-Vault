#3rd-Level #Arcana #Puppeteering
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 20'
- Duration: Instantaneous  

You focus momentarily on your surroundings, then unleash a series of bends to the arcane web to push and pull on different locations, allowing you to perform any combination of up to 4 actions, each being either a major interaction action or a disorient action consecutively, as if your reach was the spell's range. The DC against these disorient actions is your spellcasting DC.
 
**At Higher Levels:** You may perform an additional action for each spell level above 3rd.
