- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 1000'
- Duration: Instantaneous  

You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction.  

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is not [[Conditions#Encumbered|encumbered]], who must be within 5' of you when you cast this spell.
 
If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 3d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.
