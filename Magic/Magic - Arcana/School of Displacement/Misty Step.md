#2nd-Level #Arcana #Displacement
 
- Casting Time: Quick action or action
- Range: Self or touch
- Duration: Instantaneous  

Using a quick action, you transpose your energy through the web, allowing you to gain purchase and transport yourself to an unoccupied point in space you can see within 30'. 

If you use an action to cast this spell instead of a quick action, you can attempt to pull another willing creature you can see within 30' to an unoccupied point within your touch range. They make a reaction check, being transported on a success.
