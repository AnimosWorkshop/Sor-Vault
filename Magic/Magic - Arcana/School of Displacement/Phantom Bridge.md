#1st-Level #Arcana #Displacement
 
- Casting time: 1 minute
- Range: 40' (10' wide line)
- Duration: 1 hour  

You provide a supporting uplifting force in a line starting from under your feet, allowing creatures to move on it as if it were solid ground. The slope can be as steep as 10 degrees, resulting in up to a 7' height difference (when cast at 1st-level). Any creatures present within the line's area as it's being made are pushed up to stand atop it. A total weight of 1500 lb may safely stand on the platform, with any weight more than that causing the bridge to dissipate back into air.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The platform may carry additional 500 lb and extend 20' farther for each spell level above 1st. You may also make the bridge opaque instead of transparent.
