A creature that can hear you within range is bestowed a poisonous curse, causing them to tremble. The creature must make a Resilience save or be affected by the curse, taking 3d4 poison damage in the beginning of each of their turns and being [[Conditions#Weakened|weakened]] until the curse ends. On the end of the cursed creature's turn, they may reattempt the save.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The poison damage is increased by 1d4 for each spell level above 1st.
