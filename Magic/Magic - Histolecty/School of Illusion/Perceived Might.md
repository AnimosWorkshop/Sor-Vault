Rare (Source - [[Blessing of the Bard]])
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 60'
- Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour  

You fabricate an illusion to make yourself seem more powerful than you actually are, and attempt to deceive creatures around you. A creature you can see within range must make a Wits saving throw or perceive you as such, granting you a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls against them, a +2 bonus to saving throws against their effects, and a +2 bonus to ability checks made against them, such as Perception (Wisdom) checks to detect them.  

Whenever you fail an attack roll against that creature, they may use a reaction to attempt a Wits saving throw, ending the effect on them on a success.
 
**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell at 2nd level or higher, you may choose another creature within range for each spell level above 1st.
