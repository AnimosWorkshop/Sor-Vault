#2nd-Level #Histolecty #Illusion
 
- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 90' (15' sphere)
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes  

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through the sphere's area, centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component (which by default, all spells do) is impossible there.
