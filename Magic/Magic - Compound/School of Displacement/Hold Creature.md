- Casting Time: Action
- Range: 30'
- Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes  

You use a creature's surroundings in order to suppress their movement, paralyzing them for the duration. You choose a medium or smaller creature within range when casting this spell. On the start of each of their turns, they must make a Resilience saving throw or be stunned until the start of their next turn. They break free from the curse on a success, and take 1d4 psychic damage on a fail.  
><u>Note:</u> The way this spell is worded, the creature is not stunned by this spell until they attempt the save on the start of their turn after this spell is cast, no matter if they succeed or fail on that first save. This is intentional by design.
 
**At Higher Levels:** You may either choose another target or have one of the affected creatures be 1 size larger for each spell level above 1st.
