As a creature within your reach attempts to make a move, you perform deft and quick movements to prevent them from doing so. The creature must make a Willpower saving throw or stop what they were doing:

- If this spell was cast in response to an action or quick action, it stops.
- If this spell was cast in response to movement, the creature's movement becomes 0 until the end of their turn.
