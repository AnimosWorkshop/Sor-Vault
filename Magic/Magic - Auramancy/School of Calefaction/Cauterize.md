You burn a creature's wound in order to magically cauterize it and protect them from further damage. The creature may make a Resilience saving throw if they aren't willing, avoiding the spell on a success. The creature takes 1d10 + your auramancy modifier fire damage, and gains temporary hit points equal to thrice the fire damage taken.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The creature takes 1d6 additional fire damage for each spell level above 2nd.
