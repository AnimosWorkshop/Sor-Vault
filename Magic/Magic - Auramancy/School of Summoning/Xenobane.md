_The dragons stepped forward, mace in hand, ready to deal with the pests who invaded their home. Their differences might have been some which could be settled, but today was not the day for that; their weapons, hate-fueled, were held forth as a challenge to those dared to step in._
 
You infuse a weapon in your hand with an instinct of hatred against those different from you. The weapon's damage die increases by 1 for the attack for each size category difference between the attacker and the attacked creature, plus by an additional 1 if the attacker and attacked creatures are of different creature types.
 
**At Higher Levels:** The weapon's base damage die increases by 2 for each spell level above 1st.
