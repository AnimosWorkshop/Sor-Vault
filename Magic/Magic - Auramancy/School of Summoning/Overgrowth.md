#3rd-Level #Auramancy #Summoning
 
- Casting Time: Action and quick action
- Range: 60'
- Duration: 1 hour  

After choosing a point on the ground within range, you make the soil produce enough organic material to grow a 60' wide, 5' deep and 10' high wall from it. It decays over the duration, cannot serve any eating purpose, and turns to dust when the duration ends. The wall's dimensions can be smaller than the ones noted.  
Every 5' by 5' section of the wall can be destroyed with slashing or fire damage by dealing a total of 30 damage to it using these types, having AC 13. A critical hit with these damage types causes breakage.
 
**At Higher Levels:** Each section of the wall has 1 higher AC and can take 10 more damage before being destroyed for each spell level above 3rd.
